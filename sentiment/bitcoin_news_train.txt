Article 2: Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin ETFs, Frog-Themed Tokens See Renewed Interest
Content:
By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and the broader crypto market are facing renewed pressure, reversing some of gains made after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell downplayed concerns about tariff-driven inflation . President Donald Trump is reportedly scheduled to speak at Blockworks' Digital Asset Summit in New York later, with traders keen to hear how the administration plans to acquire BTC in a budget-neutral manner. Don't get too excited, the likelihood of such an announcement remains low. Trump is more likely to reiterate his aspiration to make America the "crypto capital of the world," and even this may overwhelm markets. On a more positive note, renewed interest in U.S.-listed spot ETFs supports market strength. On Wednesday, bitcoin ETFs experienced a total net inflow of $11.8 million, a fourth consecutive day of positive flows, according to Farside Investors . In contrast, ether spot ETFs recorded a net outflow of $11.7 million, extending a streak of withdrawals to 11 straight days. "Several catalysts continue to support a bullish outlook," Blockhead Research Network said. "The U.S. government exploring budget-neutral ways to accumulate bitcoin could be a game-changing factor for this cycle. Additionally, solana futures being added to the CME is a major bullish indicator for altcoins, potentially increasing institutional exposure to SOL." Speaking of on-chain flows, data from IntoTheBlock reveals that whales now hold some 62,000 more BTC than they did at the beginning of the month, indicating a resurgence in accumulation following nearly a year of declining balances. XRP whales have also been buying over the past two months. For its part, the SUI token has remained resilient, looking to build on its Wednesday gains in the wake of Canary Capital Group, an institutional crypto trading and management firm, filing for a Sui exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the SEC. In wider market news, a domain claim page for Hyperlane, an open interoperability framework, surfaced, sparking speculation of a potential token airdrop on social media. Traditional markets offered mixed cues, with dollar-yen staring at a death cross pattern, teasing a major surge ahead in the Japanese currency, which is seen as an anti-risk holding. Meanwhile, copper neared a record high in a positive sign for risky assets. Stay alert!

He responded "ok" to a user’s suggestion that he change his display name to "Kekius Maximus," amplifying attention on frog-related memes and tokens. The name is linked to existing frog-themed coins like pepe, featuring a frog dressed up as a Roman gladiator. Musk’s endorsement sparked speculation about whether he’s hinting at backing the existing KEKIUS token or just joining the day’s festivities — albeit creating volatility in such tokens. The phrase surged in visibility when Musk first made Kekius Maximus his display name on X on Dec. 31. The Kek connection also nods to the " Cult of Kek ," a tongue-in-cheek internet phenomenon linking the term to an ancient Egyptian frog-headed deity of chaos and darkness. The eponymous token issued at the time jumped to a market capitalization of nearly $200 million shortly after issuance only to crater more than 95% after the initial hype subsided. Memecoins tend to surge when Musk references them due to his massive influence and cult-like following. Such tokens are often sentiment-driven and thrive on such attention turning Musk’s playful nods — like a mere mention — into price catalysts. Derivatives Positioning BTC global futures open interest has increased to $13.3 billion, the highest since March 4, Coinglass data show. ETH open interest remains below $2 billion. Basis in the CME's BTC one-month futures has dropped below an annualized 5% despite overnight price gains, suggesting a lack of participation from institutional traders. ETH basis remains around 5%. DOGE, APT, XMR, BCH, XRP, LTC, ADA and NEAR see negative cumulative volume delta, implying net selling amid the price bounce. Deribit's BTC options have flipped bullish, with front and near-dated calls now trading pricier than puts. ETH, however, lags in sentiment.

According to one analyst's trading note, the idea that inflationary pressures will subside is "wishful thinking at best."
Article 4: Gold Surges, Bitcoin Rallies, Stocks Down Since Trump's Electoral Win — What’s Driving the Chaos?
Content:
Pro-crypto Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election over four months ago, and since then, the period has been characterized by financial market turbulence and global uncertainties surrounding tariffs, geopolitical tensions, and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia. Bitcoin (BTC) has surged over 23% since the Nov. 5 election, reaching an all-time high of over $109K at the end of January. Despite a subsequent 30% decline from its peak, it remains one of the best-performing assets. Strategy (MSTR) , often considered a bitcoin proxy, has gained 34%, recovering well under the Trump administration despite previously dropping around 60% from its November highs. Ethereum's ether token (ETH) has fallen by as much as 18%, alongside disappointing action in the broader crypto market. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Mining ETF has also struggled, dropping almost 30%. Meanwhile, investors have rotated money into BTC, pushing its dominance rate higher by 2% to over 61. European equities have done well, outshining their U.S. counterparts. The German DAX index is up 20%, and the UK’s FTSE 100 has gained 6%, alongside weaker performances in the U.S. stock market, where the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are both down approximately 2%. A recent report from Bank of America highlights a record drop in U.S. stock allocations. Gold, benefiting from uncertainty, has continued to set new all-time highs, surpassing $3,030—an 11% increase. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) , which measures the dollar's strength against a basket of major currencies, remains flat. However, under Trump, the dollar has weakened significantly, providing some relief to risk assets and major currencies such as the Euro and the Great British Pound. Meanwhile, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has slightly declined to 4.2%, a key metric the administration is closely monitoring. Oil prices have plummeted by around 7% as the U.S. maintains its stance on energy dominance to reduce energy costs. Notably, some of the so-called "Magnificent 7" stocks have struggled, with NVIDIA (NVDA) down 16% and Tesla (TSLA) declining 6%. Detox underway? Recent losses on Wall Street and in the crypto market have ignited hopes for the "Trump put," or potential policy support. However, the administration appears willing to endure short-term pain for long-term benefits, believing that this approach will cleanse the markets of the fiscal spending excesses of the Biden era. This reset is expected to be characterized lower inflation, improved energy security, and a lower 10-year Treasury yield . "Scott Bessent’s talk of a “detox period” suggests a controlled downturn might be ahead. If that’s the case, Trump’s playbook seems clear: blame the recession on Biden, use tariffs and crypto narratives to manage costs, and push for lower interest rates to fuel tech and AI growth. Short-term pain, long-term gain—that’s the strategy," Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, said in an email to CoinDesk this week. "Regardless, I don't see BTC falling below 70k, possibly 73-78k which is a solid time to enter for any buyers on the fence. In the next 1-2 years, BTC at 200k isn’t as far-fetched as most would think," Chen added.

Article 8: Visionary Move: Pakistan Eyes Revolutionary Legal Framework for Cryptocurrency Trading
Content:
Pakistan is making waves in the cryptocurrency world! In a potentially transformative move, the nation is actively exploring the creation of a legal framework to govern cryptocurrency trading. This exciting development, reported by Bloomberg, signals a significant shift in Pakistan’s approach to digital assets and could open doors to substantial foreign investment. With millions already engaged in the crypto sphere, could Pakistan be on the verge of becoming a major player in the global crypto landscape? Pakistan’s Crypto Adoption: A Sleeping Giant Awakens? While often discussed in the context of larger economies, Pakistan quietly boasts a significant cryptocurrency user base. According to Bilal bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, a staggering 15 to 20 million Pakistanis are already involved in the crypto market. This impressive figure underscores the organic growth and grassroots adoption of digital currencies within the country. Furthermore, data from Chainalysis reveals Pakistan’s position as the ninth highest nation globally in terms of crypto adoption. This places Pakistan ahead of many developed nations, highlighting the immense potential and existing interest in digital assets within its borders. Metric Pakistan’s Ranking/Figure Significance Crypto Users (Estimated) 15-20 Million Large and active user base Global Crypto Adoption Rank (Chainalysis) 9th High global ranking, indicating strong interest This robust adoption rate suggests that Pakistan isn’t just dipping its toes into crypto; it’s already immersed. The question now becomes: how can Pakistan harness this existing enthusiasm and channel it into a regulated and beneficial ecosystem? The answer, it seems, lies in establishing a clear and supportive legal framework cryptocurrency . Why Now? The Drivers Behind Pakistan’s Crypto Policy Shift Several factors are likely contributing to Pakistan’s proactive stance on crypto regulation Pakistan . The primary driver appears to be the desire to attract foreign investment. In today’s globalized economy, nations are constantly vying for capital, and embracing emerging technologies like cryptocurrency can be a powerful magnet for international funds. By creating a regulated environment, Pakistan aims to signal to foreign investors that it is a safe and welcoming destination for crypto-related businesses and investments. Bilal bin Saqib also highlighted another intriguing factor: the potential influence of global political figures. He specifically mentioned former US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Saqib suggests that Trump’s policies could create a global domino effect, compelling other nations, including Pakistan, to adopt similar, crypto-friendly regulations. This geopolitical dimension adds another layer of complexity to Pakistan’s decision-making process. It implies that Pakistan crypto policy isn’t being formulated in isolation but is also influenced by international trends and the actions of major global players. Consider these key reasons pushing Pakistan towards a legal framework cryptocurrency : Attracting Foreign Investment: A regulated crypto sector can attract significant foreign capital. Capitalizing on Existing Adoption: Formalizing the market can bring the already large user base into a regulated ecosystem, potentially boosting tax revenue and providing consumer protection. Global Trends and Geopolitics: Following international movements towards crypto regulation and potentially aligning with pro-crypto global leaders. Economic Growth and Innovation: Embracing new technologies can stimulate economic growth and foster innovation within the financial sector. Benefits of a Robust Crypto Regulation Pakistan Framework Establishing a clear and comprehensive crypto regulation Pakistan framework could unlock numerous benefits for the nation. Let’s explore some of the key advantages: Increased Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): A regulated market instills confidence in foreign investors, making Pakistan a more attractive destination for crypto businesses and investment. Enhanced Tax Revenue: Bringing crypto trading into the formal economy allows the government to collect taxes on transactions and profits, boosting national revenue. Consumer Protection: Regulation can provide safeguards for crypto users, protecting them from scams, fraud, and market manipulation. This is crucial in fostering trust and wider adoption. Financial Innovation and Inclusion: A supportive regulatory environment can encourage innovation in the fintech sector and promote financial inclusion by providing access to digital financial services for a broader population. Job Creation: The growth of the crypto industry can lead to the creation of new jobs in technology, finance, and related sectors. Combating Illicit Activities: Regulation can help in monitoring and controlling illicit activities often associated with unregulated crypto markets, such as money laundering and terrorist financing. Challenges and Considerations for Pakistan Crypto Adoption While the potential benefits are substantial, Pakistan must also navigate several challenges in implementing a legal framework cryptocurrency . These challenges require careful consideration and strategic planning: Regulatory Uncertainty: Developing effective and balanced regulations for a rapidly evolving technology like cryptocurrency is complex. Regulations must be adaptable and avoid stifling innovation. Enforcement and Compliance: Ensuring compliance with regulations can be challenging, especially in a decentralized and cross-border environment like the crypto market. Investor Education and Awareness: Many users may lack sufficient understanding of the risks associated with crypto investments. Investor education programs are crucial to promote responsible participation. Technological Infrastructure: Pakistan needs to ensure it has the necessary technological infrastructure and expertise to support a regulated crypto ecosystem. Inter-Agency Coordination: Effective regulation requires coordination between various government agencies, including financial regulators, tax authorities, and law enforcement. Global Best Practices: Pakistan can learn from the experiences of other countries that have already implemented crypto regulations, adopting best practices and avoiding potential pitfalls. The Road Ahead for Pakistan’s Crypto Journey Pakistan’s move towards establishing a legal framework cryptocurrency is a significant step forward. It reflects a growing global recognition of the importance of digital assets and the need to integrate them into the mainstream financial system. While the specifics of the regulatory framework are yet to be defined, the intent to create a regulated environment is clear. This development positions Pakistan to potentially unlock the economic benefits of its already substantial Pakistan crypto adoption and attract foreign investment in the burgeoning digital asset space. The coming months will be crucial as Pakistan develops and implements its crypto regulations. The world will be watching to see how this nation, with its impressive crypto user base, shapes its digital future and contributes to the evolving global crypto landscape. Will Pakistan become a crypto haven? Only time will tell, but the current trajectory is certainly promising and signals a bold and visionary approach to the future of finance.

Bithumb is reportedly under investigation by Korean prosecutors for allegedly using company money to support the former CEO’s apartment purchase. South Korean prosecutors have reportedly raided the headquarters of cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb over allegations that the company’s funds were used to assist its former CEO in purchasing an apartment. According to Korean news channel YTN, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor’s Office conducted the raid on Bithumb’s office in Yeoksam-dong.

Article 14: Wall Street Legend Predicts Massive XRP Market Boom with this Surprising Milkshake Theory
Content:
A prominent Wall Street figure, Linda P. Jones, has sparked excitement in the cryptocurrency world by supporting the XRP Milkshake Theory. In a post on X, she enthusiastically stated, “Loved the Milkshake Theory and I totally agree with you! Massive demand for XRP is coming!” This endorsement from a seasoned financial expert has ignited curiosity among investors and analysts, blending insights from traditional finance with the dynamic crypto market. Understanding the XRP Milkshake Theory The XRP Milkshake Theory is inspired by the Dollar Milkshake Theory, which predicts that a strengthening U.S. dollar will draw liquidity away from weaker global currencies. In a bold twist, the XRP version posits that XRP, a cryptocurrency developed by Ripple , could become a similar magnet for liquidity. Instead of the dollar, XRP might pull funds from traditional financial systems and competing cryptocurrencies. If this theory holds true, it could significantly increase XRP’s demand and market presence. Crypto analyst Brad Kimes explored this idea in his video, * “XRP- XRP Milkshake Theory – SEC Settlement? – XRP Double Digits,” suggesting that liquidity could flow into XRP from multiple sources. While exact predictions remain speculative, the concept aligns with broader market trends showing shifts in liquidity across different asset types. The buzz around XRP is set to intensify with the XRP Las Vegas 2025 conference, scheduled for May 30-31 at the MGM Grand. This event is a major gathering featuring influential speakers like Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo, and Dr. Chris Brummer. The timing is notable, coinciding with progress on the Stablecoin Bill—also called the Genius Act—which has advanced through Senate committees. This legislation could establish clearer rules for digital assets, potentially boosting institutional and retail investors’ confidence. Though hard data on XRP’s future surge is limited, the Milkshake Theory draws from observable market patterns. Recent months have shown liquidity moving across asset classes, and if XRP captures a share of this flow, its trading volume—currently around $1.2 billion daily, according to CoinMarketCap on March 17, 2025—and market capitalization could climb significantly. Jones’s support lends credibility to this view, given her extensive Wall Street background in analyzing liquidity and market trends. Ripple Vs. SEC: Regulatory Progress Adds Momentum The Stablecoin Bill’s advancement is a critical piece of the puzzle. As it nears a Senate vote, it could provide a structured framework for digital currencies, encouraging broader adoption. While focused on stablecoins, the bill’s implications could ripple through the crypto market, including XRP, by fostering a more predictable environment for investment. Jones’s endorsement signals a growing bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Her belief in the Milkshake Theory highlights how established financial principles might unlock new opportunities in the digital asset space. With regulatory clarity on the horizon and high-profile events like XRP Las Vegas 2025 approaching, the stage is set for potentially transformative shifts. Whether XRP surges to new heights or not, the interplay of data, theory, and policy is reshaping how investors view this market.
Article 15: Bitcoin Reversal Soon? Polymarket Shows 100% Odds Of Fed Ending QT Before May
Content:
Bitcoin (BTC) could soon see a trend reversal as leading prediction market platform Polymarket forecasts the US Federal Reserve (Fed) ending quantitative tightening (QT) by April 30. An end to restrictive monetary policy could provide a much-needed boost for risk-on assets like BTC. Fed Likely To End QT Before May Bitcoin has dropped nearly 13% over the past month due to a mix of unfavorable factors, including US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs and the Fed’s restrictive monetary stance. Over the past two months, the leading digital asset has tumbled from an all-time high (ATH) of $109,588 on January 19 to trading in the low $80,000 range at the time of writing – wiping out more than $400 billion from its market cap. However, the tide may soon turn for the flagship cryptocurrency. Leading prediction market platform Polymarket now projects a 100% chance that the Fed will end its restrictive monetary policy – QT – before May. Such a shift is expected to benefit risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. For the uninitiated, QT is a monetary policy where the central bank reduces its balance sheet by selling government bonds or letting them mature without reinvesting, effectively pulling liquidity out of the economy. For Bitcoin, this often leads to lower prices because less liquidity means less cash available for riskier assets like crypto. QT is one of the key monetary tools the Fed uses to restrict liquidity in the economy. The other primary tool is raising short-term interest rates, which discourages borrowing and investment in riskier assets, typically leading to price corrections in both stocks and cryptocurrencies. The Fed began its current QT cycle in June 2022, aiming to tighten market liquidity and combat rising inflation – a byproduct of pandemic-era stimulus measures. The February Consumer Price Index (CPI) report shows inflation has cooled to 2.8%, nearing the Fed’s long-run inflation target of 2%, suggesting that QT may have achieved its intended effect. Q2 2025 To Be Bullish For Bitcoin? If Polymarket’s predictions prove accurate and the Fed halts QT before May, Q2 2025 could turn bullish for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Benjamin Cowen, CEO of Into The Cryptoverse, echoed this sentiment, recently stating that an end to QT would likely trigger a market rally. Recent pro-Bitcoin remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell have added further optimism about the cryptocurrency’s recovery potential. However, concerns persist over Bitcoin’s continued behavior as a speculative asset rather than a stable store of value. Despite this, institutional confidence remains strong. Asset management firm ARK Invest recently invested another $80 million in BTC, reinforcing faith in the digital asset’s long-term potential. At press time, BTC trades at $83,707, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours.

Article 21: MSTR Stock Price Breakout Confirmed: Is A New ATH Just Around the Corner?
Content:
After weeks of instability and unpredictability amid Trump’s trade war and the FOMC meeting, the MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock is gaining momentum. The Fed’s decision to keep the interest rate unchanged has played the biggest role, as it influenced the financial market, including stock and crypto. In this, Bitcoin and the rest of altcoin showed a significant recovery; as a result, the MSTR stock price surged with the BTC surge. Interestingly, crypto analysts believe this is just the beginning, as a breakout is confirmed. What does this mean, and will MSTR hit a new ATH? Let’s discuss. MSTR Stock Price Soars 7% Today Under the impact of the U.S. Fed’s unchanged interest rate, the MSTR stock price is flourishing with gains, grabbing a 7% increase today. The stock currently trades at $304.23 and maintains a movement between the high of $309 and the low of $287.12. However, despite the surge, it is 43% away from its 52-week prime of $542.99, showing space for potential growth. Interestingly, analysts hint at the potential rally due to a breakout confirmation. MSTR Stock Price Breakout Confirmed The MicroStrategy stock price chart reveals that a potential breakout might be in formation after a five-month consolidation phase. Notably, the stock has been in a significant downtrend ever since it hit the peak of $543.98 in December 2024. However, this drop was due to a wedge pattern formation, but now it has reached its bottom, and the recent surge above the upper trendline signals the breakout potential. In addition, there is strong buying interest, as explained by the increased volume. The technical stats also reveal that the MSTR stock price is approaching the 50-day MA at $317.99. Once the stock surpasses this, the next stop is the 200 MA at $327.17, an important key resistance level. If it moves up from here, an uptrend is confirmed. Interestingly, technical factors like RSI and MACD reveal bullish momentum, which is why some anticipate a potential for new ATH. How High Can MicroStrategy Stock Surge? According to the equity trader and the crypto analyst Gladiator’s X post , the breakout from the 5-month base would result in the rally to a new ATH. More importantly, he believes that the ATH would take place within a month. This is because the longer the stock consolidates, the stronger the breakout forms. MSTR is breaking out of a 5-month base. All time highs within a month. Although this correlation is clear, Bitcoin buying is another factor in pushing it towards new highs. Recently, MicroStrategy announced to raise $500M to buy more Bitcoin, fueling anticipation of further growth due to BTC holding. More importantly, experts believe BTC awaits a massive rally , which could benefit the MSTR due to its direct correlation. With this, MicroStrategy’s stock price would likely cross $400, and the continuity of momentum could lead to new highs near $600 in optimistic scenarios. Bottom Line: New ATH Just Around The Corner With MicroStrategy stock’s recent price surge and the formation of a bullish reversal pattern, analysts like Gladiator anticipate a new ATH within a month. This is because of the strong breakout from the 5-month base, where if the MSTR stock surpassed the key resistance, its price could hit new milestones. However, the possibility of trend reversal and downtrend should always be considered due to the market’s unpredictability.

Article 22: Ripple v. SEC: Is the Lawsuit Really Over, or Is There More to the Story?
Content:
TL;DR The SEC dropped its appeal, seemingly marking the end of its lawsuit against Ripple, though certain legal matters remain unresolved. Lawyers debate whether Ripple should appeal its $125M fine, with some warning it could be a risky move. Was This The End? After more than four years of court battles, countless rulings, and developments, the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally reached its conclusion. The company’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced the breaking news, stating that the agency has dropped its appeal, which means the case “has ended and it’s over.” The disclosure triggered huge excitement across the XRP army, and many X users started celebrating the victory. However, some legal experts noted that the lawsuit has technically not yet been concluded . The US lawyer Jeremy Hogan (who has been following the case’s development over the past few years) suggested the “bad stuff” is over, but Ripple can now prolong the battle in different ways . He pointed out the $125 million fine that Judge Torres ordered on the company last year for violating certain securities laws. According to Hogan, there are four possible scenarios from here on. First, he thinks Ripple can continue its appeal to the penalty and “get a ruling from an appellate court on whether investment contracts require contracts.” Second, the firm might agree to drop its appeal, and then both parties could try to amend the judgment. The third option includes the two sides entering a mutual agreement without attempting to change Judge Torres’ ruling. Lastly, Hogan believes Ripple might decide to pay the multi-million fine “and move on.” The Appeal Seems Like an ‘Unnecessary Gamble’ Another popular attorney who touched upon the matter was Fred Rispoli. He described Ripple’s potential appeal as an “unnecessary gamble” for three important reasons. First, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit can rule against the company, which could cause serious reputational damage. He also believes that federal legislation “can essentially erase the loss.” Last but not least, Rispoli claimed that Ripple has already claimed that its operations did not engage in any of the activities that were previously deemed illegal . “ But: Maintaining it for now IS the legal “consideration” that would sufficiently justify reducing $ 125M penalty in exchanging for dropping appeal ,” he added.

Article 24: Ripple’s Victory: Former CFTC Chair “Crypto Dad” Feels Vindicated
Content:
Christopher Giancarlo, ex-chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has publicly expressed his vindication following Ripple’s significant legal triumph over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Known as “Crypto Dad” within the digital asset community, Giancarlo reaffirmed that his earlier views on the XRP Ledger have now been validated by legal precedent. In 2020, before the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple , Christopher Giancarlo co-authored a pivotal white paper with commodities attorney Conrad Bahlke. The paper presented a compelling argument: XRP should not be classified as a security. Instead, Giancarlo and Bahlke contended that XRP functions more like a currency, distinguishing it from the traditional securities framework under U.S. law. Thanks, @s_alderoty . I did indeed call the #XRPLedger as I saw it and, what do you know, so does the law. Big chapeau to you and the @Ripple team. https://t.co/Ioyphng7jK — Chris Giancarlo (@giancarloMKTS) March 19, 2025 Ripple vs. SEC: A Long and Hard-Fought Battle The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple accused the company of unlawfully offering XRP as an unregistered security. This legal battle became a landmark case for the cryptocurrency industry, drawing global attention and setting a precedent for digital asset regulation. At the time, Giancarlo’s argument was met with skepticism. Many dismissed his assessment due to his firm’s advisory relationship with Ripple. Critics also pointed out that his findings relied heavily on company-provided data, questioning the impartiality of his conclusions. Despite these doubts, Ripple remained steadfast in its defense, arguing that XRP did not fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction. SEC Withdraws Appeal, Marking a Turning Point After years of legal wrangling, the SEC has withdrawn its appeal , marking the end of the high-profile case. This development secures Ripple’s legal victory and reinforces the argument that XRP should not be classified as a security. With this resolution, the cryptocurrency industry sees a significant regulatory shift, potentially impacting how other digital assets are viewed under U.S. securities laws. The decision could provide a clearer path for blockchain projects seeking compliance with financial regulations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Acknowledgment from Ripple’s Leadership Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, publicly recognized Giancarlo’s unwavering support. Reflecting on the early days of the legal battle, Alderoty noted that while many hesitated to back Ripple, Giancarlo stood firm in his stance. “Five years ago, while many were rooting against us, even those who stood by us chose to do so silently. You were smart and brave enough to call it as you saw it. Thank you,” Alderoty said. Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation Ripple’s legal victory holds far-reaching implications for the broader cryptocurrency sector. The case has underscored the need for clearer regulatory guidelines and has sparked discussions on how digital assets should be classified. With XRP’s status as a non-security now affirmed, other blockchain projects may find renewed confidence in pushing back against regulatory overreach. As regulatory bodies worldwide continue to evaluate digital assets, Ripple’s victory could serve as a pivotal moment in shaping the legal landscape for cryptocurrencies.

Article 25: Urgent Asia FX Markets Digest Fed Outlook: Dollar Weakens as Yen Gains Momentum
Content:
Navigating the cryptocurrency market requires a keen eye on global financial trends. Right now, the forex market, particularly in Asia, is sending signals that crypto investors shouldn’t ignore. The latest Federal Reserve (Fed) outlook is causing ripples, leading to a weaker dollar and a stronger yen. But what does this mean for the broader financial landscape and your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive into the critical developments in Asia FX Markets and understand the implications. Why are Asia FX Markets Reacting Mutely to the Fed? The initial reaction in Asia FX Markets to the Federal Reserve’s recent announcements has been somewhat muted. This might seem counterintuitive, given the Fed’s significant influence on global markets. However, several factors are contributing to this cautious response: Already Priced In Expectations: Much of the Fed’s current stance might already be factored into Asian currency valuations. Markets are forward-looking, and traders may have anticipated the Fed’s direction. Regional Economic Factors: Domestic economic conditions within Asian countries play a crucial role. For instance, strong export data from some Asian economies could offset the impact of the Fed’s policies. Local Central Bank Policies: Asian central banks also have their own monetary policies to manage inflation and growth. Their actions can buffer or amplify the effects of the Fed’s decisions. Risk Aversion and Uncertainty: Global economic uncertainty, including geopolitical tensions and concerns about growth slowdown, can lead to risk aversion, impacting currency flows and muting immediate reactions. In essence, while the Fed’s outlook is a major driver, it’s just one piece of the puzzle influencing Asia FX Markets . Dollar Weakens: A Sign of Changing Tides? One of the most noteworthy developments is that the Dollar Weakens in the wake of the Fed’s announcements. A weaker dollar can have wide-ranging implications, not just for forex but also for commodity prices and, indirectly, for cryptocurrency markets. Here’s why the dollar’s weakness is significant: Reduced Appeal for Dollar-Denominated Assets: A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated assets less attractive to foreign investors. This can lead to capital outflows from dollar assets. Boost for Emerging Markets: Emerging market currencies, including many in Asia, can benefit from a weaker dollar as it reduces the debt burden for countries that have dollar-denominated debt. Commodity Price Impact: Commodities, often priced in dollars, tend to become more expensive for holders of other currencies when the dollar weakens. This can contribute to inflationary pressures. Potential Crypto Correlation: Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the dollar and some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. A weaker dollar might, in certain contexts, increase the appeal of alternative assets like crypto as a hedge. However, it’s crucial to remember that correlation is not causation, and various factors influence crypto prices. Still, the trend of the Dollar Weakens is a market signal worth monitoring. Yen Gains Momentum: What’s Driving the Surge? While the dollar is losing ground, the Yen Gains Momentum , standing out as a notable performer in the Asian forex space. The yen’s strength is driven by a combination of factors: Factor Description Safe-Haven Demand In times of global economic uncertainty, the yen is often seen as a safe-haven currency. Investors flock to it during periods of risk aversion. Bank of Japan (BOJ) Policy Speculation Although the BOJ has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy, there’s increasing speculation that they might eventually adjust their stance, which boosts the yen’s appeal. Carry Trade Unwinding The yen has historically been used in carry trades (borrowing in yen to invest in higher-yielding currencies). As global conditions change, unwinding these trades can lead to yen buying and appreciation. Dollar Weakness Amplification As the dollar weakens, currencies like the yen, which have traditionally moved inversely to the dollar, tend to strengthen. The Yen Gains Momentum not just against the dollar but also against other Asian currencies, highlighting its current strength in the forex market. Decoding the Federal Reserve Outlook: Key Takeaways The Federal Reserve Outlook is central to understanding these currency movements. What were the key signals from the Fed that are influencing the markets? Interest Rate Path: The Fed’s guidance on future interest rate hikes (or potential pauses) is crucial. Any indication of a slower pace of rate increases can lead to dollar weakness. Inflation Concerns: The Fed’s assessment of inflation – whether they see it as persistent or moderating – shapes market expectations and currency valuations. Economic Growth Projections: The Fed’s forecasts for US economic growth impact the dollar’s attractiveness. Concerns about a potential recession can weaken the dollar. Balance Sheet Reduction (Quantitative Tightening): The pace at which the Fed is reducing its balance sheet also affects liquidity and market sentiment, indirectly influencing currency markets. Investors are closely scrutinizing every statement and data point related to the Federal Reserve Outlook to anticipate future market movements. Currency Market Digest: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, how can crypto investors use this Currency Market Digest to make informed decisions? Monitor Dollar Strength: Keep an eye on the Dollar Index (DXY). A continued downtrend in the dollar might create a more favorable environment for alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. Track Yen Performance: The yen’s strength can be an indicator of broader risk aversion in the market. Increased yen buying might signal caution in traditional markets, which can sometimes spill over into crypto. Analyze Fed Communication: Stay updated on Fed statements, minutes, and speeches. Look for clues about future monetary policy and its potential impact on the dollar and global markets. Diversification Considerations: Currency movements can impact the relative value of crypto holdings. Consider diversifying across different currencies or stablecoins to mitigate currency risk. Risk Management: In times of forex volatility and uncertainty, robust risk management is paramount. Use stop-loss orders and manage your portfolio size prudently. By staying informed and understanding the dynamics of the Currency Market Digest , crypto investors can better navigate market fluctuations and potentially identify opportunities. Conclusion: Navigating Forex Winds in the Crypto Space The muted reaction in Asia FX, the weakening dollar, and the strengthening yen, all against the backdrop of the Federal Reserve outlook, paint a complex picture for global markets. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, these forex trends are not just abstract economic indicators. They are real-world signals that can influence market sentiment, capital flows, and ultimately, the value of digital assets. By paying close attention to these developments and integrating forex analysis into your crypto strategy, you can enhance your understanding of market dynamics and make more informed investment decisions. The interplay between traditional forex markets and the crypto space is becoming increasingly important, and staying ahead of these trends is key to success in the evolving financial landscape.

Article 26: Justin Sun Calls Out Ethereum’s Struggles: Price Slump, High Leverage, and the Road to Recovery
Content:
On March 13, TRON founder Justin Sun took to X with a blunt question, “What’s going on with Ethereum?” setting off a heated debate in the crypto community. His comment zeroed in on Ethereum’s price stagnation and declining market confidence. This is not the first time Sun has raised concerns about Ethereum’s trajectory. Just days earlier, on March 11, he issued a stern warning regarding the high leverage of Ethereum, which could pose a major risk to both the coin and its DeFi ecosystem. What’s Dragging Ethereum Down? ● Sluggish Price and Low Investor Confidence Ethereum has struggled this cycle, with ETH/BTC exchange rates hitting multi-year lows. Beyond technical corrections, sentiment is in the gutter. Some in the community are jokingly calling ETH the “short seller’s ATM” — suggesting that no matter when or where you short it, you’re bound to profit. ● Ecosystem Issues The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has come under fire for continuously selling ETH, offloading 4,666 ETH between January 2024 and January 2025. Critics argue this adds selling pressure while failing to leverage staking or DeFi strategies to generate sustainable returns. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s Layer 2 (L2) boom hasn’t significantly boosted the mainnet since gas fees plummeted, resulting in decreasing staking yields and weaker incentive to hold ETH than ever. ● Rising Competition and Pressure Ethereum isn’t just battling its own inefficiencies but facing regulatory challenges while losing ground to rivals. The U.S. SEC’s recent delay on Grayscale and Fidelity’s spot ETH ETF options dampened market sentiment even further. Solana and TON are making aggressive ecosystem plays, and TRON is tightening its grip on the stablecoin market, all chipping away at Ethereum’s dominance. Can the Pectra Upgrade Reshape the Ecosystem? The upcoming Pectra upgrade, combining the Prague and Electra forks, aims to improve Ethereum’s execution and consensus layers. According to HTX Research , key improvements in Pectra (EIP-7702, 3074, and 7623) will enhance projects in the sectors of modularity, chain abstraction, and account abstraction (AA) wallets. EIP-7594 (PeerDAS) introduces data availability sampling (DAS), which is expected to be advantageous for ZK Prover networks. Additional EIPs will help lower L2 transaction costs, speed up processing times, and reduce data storage expenses. What Else Can Ethereum Do to Bounce Back? Upgrades alone won’t be enough—Ethereum needs a stronger strategy to regain users and liquidity. Earlier this year, Justin Sun outlined a “First Week Plan” if he were in charge of the Ethereum Foundation. His strategy focuses on four key points: 1. Stop all ETH sales for at least three years and cover operations expenses through AAVE loans, staking yields, and stablecoin loans to maintain ETH’s deflationary model. 2. Tax all Layer 2 projects aggressively, generating at least $5 billion annually to fund ETH buybacks and burns. 3. Streamline the Ethereum Foundation’s team and increase salary for key contributors. 4. Slash validator rewards while ramping up ETH burn mechanisms. Sun believes these moves could push ETH past $4,500 within a week of implementation. Former Ethereum Foundation Solidity engineer Harikrishnan Mulackal has also voiced concerns over Ethereum’s technological stagnation due to a lack of clear development direction. He argues that an excessive focus on research is slowing real progress and Ethereum needs to shift toward product-driven innovation based on reflections on bottleneck problems over the past five years. Without major changes, the network risks repeating past trajectory. Despite the current downturn, seasoned crypto traders know Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong. Once the dust settles, Ethereum could be primed for a major resurgence in adoption and applications.

Article 27: Justin Sun Announces TRON Integration On Solana Blockchain, Increasing Access to TRX, DeFi, and NFT
Content:
Justin Sun, founder of TRON, announced that the token TRX will be available on the Solana blockchain . This announcement boosted TRON’s price by 8%, with investors and traders expecting higher transaction speeds and utility between the two major cryptocurrencies. “TRX will be soon on Solana. Ready to buy and collaborate”, wrote Sun on X. Sun announced the news without providing too many details about the process. TRON already has fast transaction speeds but may benefit from cross-chain operability. Integrating the two blockchains may increase the functionality of TRON, with Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), leading to broader cryptocurrency adoption. The move may also allow for more accessible swapping functions to increase crypto’s liquidity. TRON has one of the busiest networks, with many users and profit from fees. TRON retains around $3 million in fees per month and generates around $275 million in fees per month. The TRON blockchain is widely used for transactions, token transfers, and stablecoins. The DeFi market has been slowing down on the network. TRON is largely disconnected from other networks and even some popular exchanges. There also is a lack of interconnectivity, with not many bridges between other blockchains. NFT is largely a separate market from the main network. TRON has the functionality of a remittance token, similar to Ripple or Stellar, and can only benefit from increased accessibility. Sun’s vision is to create zero fees for stablecoin transactions on the TRON network. Integrating Solana and TRON may allow for cross-chain swaps, achieving this goal or reducing transaction costs and increasing TRON’s accessibility. In 2018, TRON transitioned from an Ethereum-based blockchain to an independent network. TRON is a well-designed project with carefully crafted code, designed with Java and OOP, but it still lacks accessibility due to its isolation. Integrating Solana, therefore, may provide more TRON access. How the two tokens will be integrated remains unclear, but the TRON token could be wrapped in Solana. Sun may provide more details in the coming days. Sun was born in Xining, China’s Qinghai province, and studied history at Peking University and East Asian studies at Pennsylvania. He then discovered Bitcoin and returned to China in 2013 as a crypto investor. Sun then became the Chief Representative of Ripple Labs and, as one of the youngest crypto millionaires, caught the eye of Alibaba’s Jack Ma, who recruited him to join the business school Hupan University. TRON surpasses Solana in terms of active users, having 3.1 million daily active users, as opposed to Solana’s 2.84 million. This results from decreased DEX activity on the Solana ecosystem and an outflow of users. TRON and Solana are two of the highest fee-generating chains, boasting low fees and thus attracting more customers. Lower fees, one could say, generate more fees because consumers prefer chains that don’t consume their funds. A Solana user created a TRX meme token immediately after Sun’s announcement, allowing the token to reach a height of $0.0006 until pulling the funds, leaving it at 99% of its value. Most of the user-created TRX tokens on Solana are scam coins. Solana caused controversy this week by creating an advertisement that joked about gender issues. The ad featured a character named America, who had a condition called rational thinking syndrome. The therapist suggested creating a new gender as a treatment. The ad confused Many crypto investors, who thought it was in poor taste. Sun has recently become one of the foremost investors in the World Liberty crypto project, a token backed by the Trump family. Sun invested around $75 million in the project, which would enrich the Trump family because it entitles them to around 75% of the profits. Sun is an official advisor to the project. Trump is the chief crypto advocate, and Baron Trump is its chief DeFi visionary. Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, started Hupan University, an exclusive entrepreneurship school. Justin Sun was one of 30 students hand-picked by Jack Ma for its inaugural class. Students of the school had to own a business for over 3 years and employ over 30 people. A further requirement was that the business have over $4 million in revenue. Justin Sun was only 25 years old at the time and gained widespread recognition in China.

Article 31: XRP Just Smashed Through This Key Resistance Level. Here’s What’s Coming Next
Content:
Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a well-known cryptocurrency analyst on X, recently highlighted a critical resistance level for XRP at $2.4. In a post analyzing the cryptocurrency’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart, Xaif emphasized that surpassing this level could pave the way for a significant price increase. #XRP is set to face a formidable challenge, with $2.40 serving as the crucial resistance level. This resistance elimination could lead $XRP to higher high pic.twitter.com/N244KkeY6k — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) March 19, 2025 The $2.4 Resistance Level The chart shared by Xaif illustrates XRP’s price distribution, showing how many coins were last moved at different price levels. One key observation is the concentration of realized price levels near the $2.4 mark. Xaif pointed out that this level represented a major hurdle for XRP, stating that $2.4 is “serving as the crucial resistance level.” The implication was that overcoming this barrier could open the door to further gains. In the chart, the highlighted data shows significant realized price distributions at various levels, particularly around $1.63 and $2.28, suggesting key points of historical accumulation. These previous resistance points may now turn into support as XRP has surpassed the $2.4 resistance level, further strengthening the cryptocurrency’s upward trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Price Surge Following SEC’s Decision The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially dropped its lawsuit against Ripple, and this monumental decision caused XRP’s price to skyrocket. The digital asset experienced a surge of over 11% , and despite a slight dip, it is now trading at $2.49, well above the $2.4 resistance level. With this breakout, the market is assessing the potential for further price appreciation. If XRP maintains its position above $2.4, it could establish a new support level, reinforcing bullish sentiment among investors. Many traders are watching closely to see if XRP can sustain its momentum and move toward higher price targets. With XRP on the move, analysts have predicted that the asset could reach $54.19 by the end of March, and without any price suppression from the Ripple lawsuit, these lofty targets are realistic to many investors. As XRP trades above this key resistance level, its price action will be closely monitored. Whales in the ecosystem are already preparing for a massive price movement , and the combination of technical factors and positive market sentiment suggests that the cryptocurrency may be positioned for continued growth.

The cryptocurrency market is up today, with the total market capitalization rising by approximately 3.2% in the last 24 hours to reach $2.8 trillion on March 20. The gains were led by Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ), which have risen around 3% and 4%, respectively. Crypto market performance Jan. 30.

Risk-on sentiment pushed the crypto market up The crypto market rebound mirrors gains in US equities following the Fed’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose by 1.08% and 1.4%, during the late New York trading session on March 19. Crypto-related stocks also climbed higher, with crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) rising by 4.75% and Strategy (MSTR) gaining nearly 7.4%.

This comes after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which saw the US central bank leave interest rates unchanged at 4.25%-4.50%, meeting market expectations. The committee now projects two rate cuts by the end of the year. The latest data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool sees 16% odds of a 0.25% cut in May with the odds increasing to 60.1% in June.

BREAKING: President Trump will address DAS tomorrow This is the first time a sitting President has addressed a crypto conference. pic.twitter.com/x3gnGP0yAN — Blockworks (@Blockworks_) March 19, 2025 There are speculations that Trump will make major updates to his administration’s crypto policies. “This would be his first major update since March 6, when the national crypto reserve was established,” capital markets commentator The Kobeissi Letter said in a March 19 post on X, adding: “Rumors state President Trump may be making a significant change to his strategy.” Trump’s recent comments about establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and his pro-crypto stance have sparked excitement among investors. Following his election, Bitcoin ETF inflows hit a record $3.4 billion per week, and Bitcoin breached the $100,000 level before setting a new all-time high above $109,000 . This reflects institutional enthusiasm for a potentially crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Combined with the Fed’s dovish stance, this optimism has resulted in BTC price rebounding above $85,000. According to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, “ QT is basically over on April 1,” highlighting that markets should now focus on potential SLR exemption or restart of QE. Hayes believes $77,000 was the likely bottom for Bitcoin. JAYPOW delivered, QT basically over Apr 1. The next thing we need to get bulled up for realz is either SLR exemption and or a restart of QE.

XRP has surged after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially dismissed its lawsuit against Ripple. The announcement fueled a 14% XRP price jump within 24 hours. The rally is backed by strong technical momentum and increased buying activity, while XRP’s network activity has also reached record highs. XRP prices surge as buyers capitalize on bullish momentum A critical technical indicator, the Directional Movement Index (DMI), indicates buyers are in control. Average Directional Index (ADX) has risen from 15.64 to 20.4. This means that the current trend is gaining strength. The ADX is not directional, meaning it doesn’t tell whether the trend is upward or downward. However, combined with the (Directional Movement Index) +DMI and -DMI indicators, they can indicate the market’s direction. In XRP’s case, the +DMI has spiked from 18.3 to 39, and the -DMI has fallen from 19.63 to 12.97. This indicates aggressive demand and softening supply. If this momentum persists, the price of XRP may increase further. The ADX must also be over 25 to indicate a strong trend — but this is already a good sign. XRP users set new activity records XRP blockchain activity is up, and active addresses reached a record 1.19 million in a week, an increase of almost five times from 237,000 on February 27. This fast pace of growth indicates a large increase in engagement and adoption of the network. This uptick in activity is indicative of interest from retail traders, institutional investors, and the market in general. This can result in lower XRP volatility and greater XRP price movements. A rise in active addresses generally translates into a growth in transactions, which can drive price volatility. But XRP’s price action remains bullish, with a golden cross pattern—a key bullish indicator—just about to form as a short-term moving average closes in on a crossover with a long-term moving average. Should this trend continue, XRP may retest the $2.648 resistance line and, if buying pressure increases, potentially hit $2.99. A breakout above this level could lead price above $3. If the momentum wanes, XRP will likely find it difficult to maintain its current range. The main level of support is at $2.47. If the price drops below $2.90, XRP may fall to $2.21 or even $1.90. Ripple CEO hints at reduced XRP sales In a recent Bloomberg interview, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse addressed concerns about the company’s XRP sales, hinting that such sales could be reduced going forward. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse- Source: Bloomberg Garlinghouse said that while Ripple holds 42% of XRP’s total supply at the moment, maybe they won’t be selling as much at some point. He also denied that Ripple’s holdings of XRP were “falsehoods.” Ripple is now faced with an important choice : Do they settle with the SEC for $125 million (money that is already in escrow) or cross-appeal, which could defy the resolution of various lingering legal questions? Garlinghouse still seems somewhat optimistic, noting that Ripple is financially healthy and that recovering the fine wouldn’t be a problem. On the other hand, Ripple is also working on expanding its ecosystem and aims to make its Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin one of the top five ranks of the market by the end of the year. This could strengthen XRP’s position even more and boost its long-term growth potential.

The post XRP Price Prediction 2030: SEC Drops Lawsuit Against Ripple | What’s Next for XRP? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The XRP Price LIVE: $ 2.47440082 . The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has dropped 2.69% in 24 hours to $2.27. In the latest update, the U.S. SEC has dropped its lawsuit against Ripple labs, which sent the XRP price soaring 9% in minutes. In other news, Ripple Labs has filed a trademark application for Ripple Custody, a secure crypto storage solution focusing on financial institutions. The regulated service lowers risks like private key loss and cyberattacks, offering dedicated infrastructure for managing XRP and other assets and enabling secure transmission, storage, and broader institutional crypto integration. Talking about the XRP price, it is currently up 6.32% to $2.44. If the bullish momentum continues, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.5989. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price will remain range-bound between its key support levels at $2.336 and $2.3403. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.47440082 6.81% Market cap $ 143,784,759,038.88 Circulating Supply 58,108,919,817.00 Trading Volume $ 10,615,426,030.7922 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as Franklin Templeton has announced filing for an XRP ETF. Once launched, it is expected to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). The exchange inflow vs outflow graph from March 1st to March 11th shows 501k outflows in comparison to 482k inflows. This signals a spike in strong investor interest, which is a big thumbs up for XRP. XRP Exchange Inflow vs Outflow If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87.

Article 38: South Korea raids Bithumb amid ex-CEO’s alleged $2M embezzlement
Content:
Update March 20, 10:50 am UTC: This article has been updated to add a Wu Blockchain report on Bithumb listings, claiming that multiple crypto projects paid intermediary fees to have their tokens listed. South Korean prosecutors raided crypto exchange Bithumb following suspicions that its former CEO embezzled funds to purchase an apartment. On March 20, Seoul’s Southern District Prosecutors’ Office reportedly searched Bithumb’s offices in the country. The investigation centered around allegations that the crypto exchange gave a 3 billion Korean won (over $2 million) apartment lease deposit to Kim Dae-sik, its former CEO and board member, who now works as an adviser to the firm. Prosecutors raised concerns over potential financial misconduct within the company, suspecting that Kim used some of the funds to purchase a personal apartment. Bithumb says its former CEO repaid the funds Local media outlet YTN reported that the country’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) had previously investigated the suspicions and handed their findings to the prosecutor’s office. In an interview with The Chosun Daily, a Bithumb representative said some of the allegations are true. The exchange said the executive took a loan from a lender immediately after the FSS investigation. After this, Bithumb said Kim repaid the funds spent on the apartment purchase in full. Apart from the apartment, rumors that projects paid intermediary fees to get listed in Bithumb also circulated online. Citing anonymous sources, Wu Blockchain reported on March 20 that two projects claimed to have paid $2 million and $10 million, respectively, to get listed on Bithumb and Upbit. The report claimed that the “intermediaries” were related to Upbit’s shareholders and market makers. Wu Blockchain also said that some intermediary fees ranged from 3% to 5% of entire token supplies. Related: Wemix denies cover-up amid delayed $6.2M bridge hack announcement Bithumb faces probe amid IPO push The investigation comes as the crypto exchange attempts another push to go public. On March 18, the Business Post reported that Bithumb CEO Lee Jae-won is expediting the process of the company’s long-awaited initial public offering (IPO). The report said the company has reorganized to eliminate judicial risks on major shareholders. In 2021, Bithumb’s former board of directors chairman, Lee Jeong-hoon, was indicted on alleged fraud charges. As South Korea’s Supreme Court acquitted the Bithumb executive, the exchange is expected to speed up its IPO in 2025. Bithumb’s IPO plans date back to 2020 when local media reported that the exchange platform had been preparing for a stock market launch . However, the company faced obstacles that prevented it from successfully conducting an IPO. In 2023, the company chose an underwriter for its IPO plans, reigniting the chatter it’s working on conducting an IPO . In 2024, the rumors were confirmed as Bithumb Korea set up a non-exchange business to accelerate its debut on the stock market. However, the news was paired with a 57% loss in annual revenue for the exchange operator in the fiscal year 2023.

Article 40: Unwavering Stability: China Holds Loan Prime Rate Steady for 5th Month – Reassuring Markets?
Content:
In a move that echoes calm across global financial markets, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has decided to maintain its loan prime rate (LPR) unchanged for the fifth consecutive month. For those watching the pulse of the crypto world, especially considering the intricate dance between traditional finance and digital assets, China’s economic decisions carry significant weight. Let’s dive into what this LPR unchanged stance really means and why it matters. Decoding the Loan Prime Rate: What is the China Loan Prime Rate? Think of the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) as a key benchmark interest rate in China. It’s not just another number; it’s a signal, a barometer of borrowing costs for businesses and individuals across the nation. The PBOC uses the LPR to influence lending rates, essentially guiding the flow of credit within the Chinese economy. It’s announced monthly and serves as a reference point for most new loans. Here’s a quick breakdown to understand its significance: Benchmark Rate: The LPR acts as the primary reference rate for banks when they issue loans. Two Tiers: There are two key LPRs: a one-year LPR (typically for corporate and household loans) and a five-year LPR (often linked to mortgages). Market-Driven: While set by the PBOC, the LPR is influenced by market supply and demand, reflecting the broader economic environment. Policy Tool: The PBOC uses adjustments to the LPR to manage economic growth, inflation, and overall financial stability. Why the Steady Hand? Exploring China Monetary Policy and the Unchanged Rate For five months straight, the PBOC has held the one-year LPR at 3.45% and the five-year LPR at 3.95%. This consistent approach in China monetary policy begs the question: why the unwavering stance? Several factors could be at play: Economic Stability Focus: Maintaining the LPR signals a desire for economic stability. Abrupt changes in interest rates can create market volatility, something the PBOC likely wants to avoid, especially in the current global economic climate. Inflation Management: Interest rates are a key tool to manage inflation. Keeping rates steady might suggest that the PBOC believes current inflation levels are within an acceptable range or that other measures are being used to control price pressures. Supporting Economic Recovery: While higher rates can curb inflation, they can also dampen economic activity. Keeping rates lower, or at least steady, can support businesses and consumers, encouraging borrowing and investment, crucial for post-pandemic recovery. Global Economic Considerations: The PBOC’s decisions are not made in isolation. Global economic trends, actions by other central banks, and international capital flows all influence China economic policy . A steady LPR might reflect a cautious approach in response to global uncertainties. It’s a balancing act. The PBOC needs to navigate between supporting economic growth, managing inflation risks, and maintaining financial stability. The decision to keep the LPR unchanged suggests a calculated approach, prioritizing stability in the near term. The Ripple Effect: Impact of PBOC Interest Rates on the Economy So, what are the potential impacts of these consistent PBOC interest rates ? Let’s break it down: Positive Impacts: Predictability for Businesses: Stable interest rates offer businesses a predictable borrowing environment, making it easier to plan investments and expansions. Support for Borrowers: Lower interest rates, even when held steady, mean borrowing remains relatively affordable for businesses and individuals, stimulating economic activity. Reduced Financial Stress: Consistent rates can reduce financial stress on borrowers, particularly those with variable-rate loans, as they avoid unexpected increases in repayment costs. Potential Challenges: Inflation Risks: If inflation pressures build up, keeping rates too low for too long could exacerbate the problem. The PBOC needs to be vigilant about monitoring inflation indicators. Asset Bubbles: Persistently low rates can sometimes fuel asset bubbles in sectors like real estate or stock markets, requiring careful monitoring and potential macroprudential measures. Limited Policy Flexibility: While stability is good, maintaining rates unchanged for too long might limit the PBOC’s flexibility to respond to unforeseen economic shocks or shifts in the future. The impact is nuanced and depends on the broader economic context. While stability is generally welcomed, the PBOC must remain agile and ready to adjust its stance if economic conditions change significantly. Connecting the Dots: China Loan Prime Rate and the Crypto Market Now, how does all of this relate to the cryptocurrency world? While seemingly distant, China loan prime rate decisions can indirectly influence crypto markets. Here’s how: Investor Sentiment: China’s economic health and policy direction significantly impact global investor sentiment. A stable economic outlook in China, signaled by steady interest rates, can contribute to a more positive global risk appetite, which can indirectly benefit risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Capital Flows: While China has a strict stance on cryptocurrency trading and mining, its overall economic policies can influence capital flows. Stable or lower interest rates, in a broader global context, might encourage some investors to seek higher yields in alternative assets, including crypto (though this is a complex and indirect relationship in China’s case). Economic Health as a Bellwether: China’s economic performance is often seen as a bellwether for the global economy. Positive signs from China, like stable interest rates indicating controlled growth, can boost confidence across markets, including crypto. It’s crucial to remember that the relationship is not direct and is mediated by numerous other factors, including global crypto adoption trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the blockchain space. Looking Ahead: What to Watch in China Economic Policy The PBOC’s decision to keep the LPR unchanged for five months is a significant signal, but it’s not the end of the story. Here’s what to keep an eye on in terms of China economic policy and potential future LPR movements: Indicator Why it Matters Potential Impact on LPR Inflation Data (CPI, PPI) Rising inflation could pressure the PBOC to raise rates to cool down the economy. Increase in LPR possible if inflation surges. GDP Growth Rate Slower-than-expected growth might prompt the PBOC to lower rates to stimulate economic activity. Decrease in LPR possible to boost growth. Global Economic Conditions Global recessions or financial crises could influence the PBOC’s monetary policy decisions. Uncertain; could lead to rate cuts to support the economy or rate hikes to manage capital flows depending on the nature of the global event. Property Market Health Significant stress in the property sector could prompt targeted easing measures, potentially impacting the five-year LPR. Potential targeted decrease in 5-year LPR to support the property market. Monitoring these indicators will provide valuable insights into the future direction of China’s monetary policy and potential shifts in the LPR. Actionable Insights: LPR Steady – What Does It Mean for You? For crypto enthusiasts and investors, the PBOC’s steady LPR offers a few key takeaways: Stability in China’s Economy is a Positive Sign: A stable Chinese economy is generally good for global markets, including crypto, fostering a more constructive risk environment. No Immediate Rate Hike Shocks Expected: The consistent LPR suggests no immediate sharp tightening of monetary policy is anticipated, reducing the risk of sudden negative shocks from that front. Focus on Broader Economic Monitoring: While the LPR is steady, it’s crucial to monitor broader economic indicators in China and globally to anticipate potential future shifts in monetary policy. Diversification Remains Key: The crypto market is influenced by numerous factors beyond China’s monetary policy. Diversification across asset classes and geographies remains a prudent strategy. Ultimately, the PBOC’s decision to maintain the LPR is a piece of a larger puzzle. Understanding its context and implications helps in navigating the complex interplay between traditional finance and the evolving world of cryptocurrencies. In Conclusion: A Steady Course in China’s Economic Waters The PBOC’s continued hold on the loan prime rate underscores a commitment to stability in China’s economic waters. This unwavering approach, while seemingly quiet, sends ripples across global markets, subtly influencing everything from business investments to investor sentiment, and even touching the fringes of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While the immediate impact on crypto may be indirect, understanding these macroeconomic currents is vital for anyone navigating the financial landscape today. The steady LPR is a reminder that in the world of finance, sometimes, no change is itself a significant message, signaling a carefully considered path forward in a complex global economy.

Article 43: Garantex Operators Allegedly Relaunch as Grinex to Evade Sanctions
Content:
Onchain security firm Cyvers has identified a surge in address poisoning scams, where attackers trick users into transferring funds to fraudulent wallet addresses. In just under three weeks, these scams have led to over $1.2 million in losses, adding to the broader trend of phishing-related fraud, which remains a major concern for crypto investors. Meanwhile, a separate investigation by Global Ledger has linked Grinex, a newly established crypto exchange, to the sanctioned trading platform Garantex. The report suggests that Garantex operators have transferred liquidity and customer funds to Grinex in an effort to circumvent US sanctions, raising concerns about regulatory enforcement and illicit financial activity. Garantex Operators Allegedly Launch New Exchange Grinex to Evade US Sanctions The operators of the now-sanctioned cryptocurrency exchange Garantex have reportedly launched a new trading platform, according to findings from blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger. The firm’s latest report claims that Grinex, a newly established exchange , is effectively a continuation of Garantex, which was blacklisted by US authorities for allegedly facilitating illicit financial transactions. Swiss-based Global Ledger revealed in its investigation that Grinex was set up shortly after Garantex’s abrupt downfall, following the US Department of Justice’s (DOJ) and European authorities’ coordinated crackdown on the platform. The analytics firm asserts that conclusive onchain evidence directly links Grinex to Garantex, reinforcing concerns that the operators are circumventing international sanctions. ”Grinex is not an independent entity but rather a full-fledged successor to Garantex, continuing its financial operations despite the exchange’s official shutdown,” Global Ledger stated in its report published on Wednesday. The DOJ, in collaboration with authorities from Germany and Finland, recently froze several domains linked to Garantex, a move aimed at dismantling its infrastructure. Since its inception in 2019, Garantex reportedly processed over $96 billion in illicit funds, playing a crucial role in laundering proceeds from darknet markets and ransomware attacks, according to US officials. In April 2022, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Garantex, marking it as the third-largest crypto exchange ever to face such penalties. Despite these sanctions, blockchain analytics firm Elliptic later reported that the exchange continued transacting approximately $60 billion in crypto following its blacklisting. The crackdown on Garantex escalated earlier this year when US authorities issued criminal indictments against its principal operators, Aleksej Besciokov and Aleksandr Mira Serda. Besciokov has since been detained in India and is currently facing extradition to the United States. Mira Serda, however, remains at large. With mounting pressure on Garantex, its operators appear to have shifted liquidity and user funds to Grinex, using it as a workaround to continue operations under a new name. Global Ledger's investigation found that Grinex is using identical infrastructure to Garantex, suggesting a direct transfer of its technology, assets, and customer base. Onchain data indicates that between Feb. 8 and March 1, Garantex facilitated the movement of billions of A7A5 stablecoin tokens on the Tron blockchain to addresses controlled by Grinex. The A7A5 stablecoin, issued by Russia’s Promsvyazbank through its cross-border payment platform A7, is reportedly being used as a ruble-backed digital currency to support Grinex’s liquidity. The findings suggest that Grinex has already processed nearly $30 million in transactions, further solidifying its operational status as an active exchange. A Test of Sanctions Enforcement The emergence of Grinex presents a significant challenge for global regulators seeking to clamp down on illicit financial networks within the crypto ecosystem. The United States and its allies have repeatedly warned that Russian-linked financial entities and exchanges are actively developing ways to bypass sanctions and continue facilitating unlawful transactions. Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, has already responded to enforcement efforts by freezing $23 million worth of USDT linked to Garantex, showcasing a coordinated industry response to illicit crypto activity. However, the creation of Grinex raises concerns about the effectiveness of existing measures and the ability of sanctioned entities to persist through strategic rebranding. The revelations from Global Ledger’s report are expected to prompt additional action from US authorities and their international partners. Investigations into Grinex’s activities could lead to further domain seizures, asset freezes, and even secondary sanctions against entities providing financial infrastructure to the new exchange. Additionally, Promsvyazbank’s involvement in issuing the A7A5 stablecoin could bring increased scrutiny to Russian banks and financial institutions facilitating crypto transactions for sanctioned actors. If confirmed, it may result in broader enforcement measures targeting Russian digital payment platforms. As authorities ramp up their efforts to curb crypto-based money laundering, the battle between regulators and illicit financial networks is poised to intensify. Crypto Investors Lose $1.2 Million to Address Poisoning Scams as Phishing Attacks Surge In other news, the cryptocurrency industry continues to grapple with an alarming rise in phishing scams, with address poisoning scams stealing over $1.2 million from unsuspecting victims in just under three weeks. According to onchain security firm Cyvers, these attacks have grown in both frequency and sophistication, exposing critical vulnerabilities in how digital assets are transferred. The latest data sheds light on a troubling trend of crypto investors falling prey to meticulously designed scams that trick them into sending funds to fraudulent addresses. The surge in these attacks raises urgent concerns about the security infrastructure of cryptocurrency transactions and the effectiveness of current fraud prevention measures. Address poisoning, also referred to as wallet poisoning, is a deceptive phishing tactic where scammers exploit users’ reliance on transaction history to send funds. Attackers send tiny transactions to a victim's wallet using an address that closely resembles one the victim has interacted with before. If a user copy-pastes the wrong address when transferring funds, they unknowingly send their assets straight into the scammer’s wallet. “Attackers send small transactions to victims, mimicking their frequently used wallet addresses. When users copy-paste an address from their transaction history, they might accidentally send funds to the scammer instead,” Cyvers wrote in a post on X on March 19. This exploit relies on users failing to carefully verify wallet addresses before transferring funds. Since blockchain transactions are irreversible, any funds sent to a scammer’s address cannot be recovered unless the attacker voluntarily returns them. According to Deddy Lavid, CEO and co-founder of Cyvers, address poisoning scams have been on the rise since the start of the year, with February alone seeing over $1.8 million in losses. Lavid attributes the growing prevalence of these scams to two key factors: The increasing sophistication of scammers, who are creating near-identical wallet addresses to deceive users. The lack of real-time pre-transaction verification mechanisms, which could prevent users from mistakenly sending funds to fraudulent addresses. ”More users and institutions are leveraging automated tools for crypto transactions, some of which may not have built-in verification mechanisms to detect poisoned addresses,” Lavid explained in an interview. The impact of address poisoning scams has not only been widespread but also financially devastating. One of the most infamous cases occurred in May 2024, when an investor mistakenly sent $71 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) to a fraudulent address. The scammer had successfully created an address mimicking the victim’s known contacts and baited them into making the costly transfer. Surprisingly, the attacker returned the funds days later, allegedly due to mounting pressure from blockchain investigators and the growing public attention on the case. However, the vast majority of victims in similar scams have had no such luck. This highlights the power of blockchain transparency, where all transactions are permanently recorded on-chain, allowing security firms and the wider crypto community to track stolen funds. While address poisoning has gained traction, pig butchering scams have emerged as another dangerous phishing scheme, with far-reaching financial consequences. Unlike address poisoning, pig butchering scams involve a much more sophisticated form of deception. Attackers establish long-term communication with victims, grooming them over weeks or even months to gain their trust before ultimately persuading them to invest in fraudulent crypto platforms. Once the victims deposit their funds, the scammers vanish with their money. According to Cyvers, pig butchering scams on the Ethereum network alone have cost the crypto industry over $5.5 billion in 2024, with over 200,000 identified cases. The average grooming period for victims lasts one to two weeks in 35% of cases, while in 10% of scams, the process extends up to three months. Data also suggests that males aged 30 to 49 are the most frequent victims, with 75% of them losing over half their net worth to these types of scams. With cryptocurrency adoption growing worldwide, phishing attacks have become the most expensive security threat to the industry in 2024. Cyvers' analysis revealed that phishing scams have resulted in over $1 billion in losses across 296 separate incidents, making them the costliest attack vector of the year. Address poisoning and pig butchering schemes are just two of the many phishing tactics deployed by scammers. Other variations include: Fake wallet applications that steal users’ private keys. Malicious phishing emails that trick users into entering sensitive information. Counterfeit customer support scams, where attackers pose as official representatives of crypto exchanges or DeFi platforms. These social engineering tactics exploit the lack of regulatory oversight in the crypto industry, making them harder to detect and prevent. How to Protect Yourself From Address Poisoning and Phishing Scams As scammers develop increasingly sophisticated strategies, investors must take proactive steps to secure their digital assets. Security experts recommend the following: Manually verify all wallet addresses before transferring funds, rather than relying on copy-paste from transaction history. Use wallet address whitelisting, available on many crypto exchanges, to ensure funds are only sent to trusted addresses. Enable real-time security features on crypto wallets that flag suspicious addresses before transactions are executed. Beware of unsolicited small transactions from unknown addresses—this could be an attempt to ”poison” your wallet history. Stay informed about emerging threats by following updates from blockchain security firms. With phishing scams evolving rapidly, prevention is the best defense. While regulators and blockchain security firms work to combat fraudulent activities, individual users must also exercise caution to avoid falling victim.
Article 44: Is Sonic’s S primed for a rally to $0.7?
Content:
Sonic could rally nearly 30% from its current price, driven by the launch of its virtual payments card and its expansion in DeFi through new partnerships. According to analyst Robert Mercer, Sonic has reclaimed key support and is breaking out of a downtrend, setting up for what the analyst labeled as a “programmed” run toward $0.60–$0.70 and possibly even $1. A chart shared by the analyst on X highlighted a bullish breakout from a descending trendline with strong momentum, which is typically a precursor for further upside. Source: X/Robert_Klondike Well-followed trader Crypto Nova echoed this bullish sentiment, noting that Sonic has retraced to key levels and is displaying healthy rebound signs. $S / Sonic not in a bad position right here imo. Retraced to previous key levels and showing healthy rebound signs. It defied the market last month with a decent rally. Probably can do so again. pic.twitter.com/J8e5sBBFZG — Crypto Nova (@CryptoGirlNova) March 20, 2025 According to data from crypto.news, Sonic ( S ) rose nearly 11% to an intraday high of $0.55 on March 20, extending its gains to over 18% from its weekly low of $0.45. Its market was seated at $1.71 billion, while its daily trading volume was up nearly double the previous day at $216 million. A major catalyst behind this rally is the launch of Sonic Pay, a virtual payment card developed in collaboration with RedotPay. The card enables users to make payments using USDC.e via Apple Pay and Google Pay, removing the friction of crypto-to-fiat conversions and expanding Sonic’s real-world utility.

Most notably, ChainGPT has integrated its AI NFT Generator, ChainGPT Pad, and DegenPad with Sonic’s high-speed blockchain infrastructure. The integration optimizes NFT minting for creators and developers, enhances fundraising opportunities for Sonic-based projects, and accelerates ecosystem growth for both investors and the broader Sonic community. Sonic has also shown strong growth in the DeFi sector. According to DefiLlama , its total value locked just hit an all-time high of $841.5 million, a noticeable jump from the $25.41 million recorded at the start of the year. It was also one of the fastest-growing blockchains by TVL in February. Meanwhile, the layer-1 blockchain is also being touted as one of the fastest chains in terms of block time, even beating major players like Solana, Arbitrum, and Base. See below. https://twitter.com/crypto_rand/status/1902391007603224810 S price analysis With community sentiment leaning heavily on the positive side technical indicators also seem to be in favor of a potential upside run. On the 4-hour/USDT price chart, Sonic continued to trade higher over the multi-week descending parallel channel pattern it broke above on March 14. S price, Aroon and RSI chart — March 20 | Source: crypto.news The Aroon Up indicator was at 85.71%, while the Aroon Down, at 7.14%, pointed to strong buying momentum. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index showed a reading of 60, which means Sonic still has room for gains before facing a selloff. The altcoin’s funding rate remained positive, along with a jump in open interest at press time per data from CoinGlass. A positive funding rate with rising OI means an increasing number of derivatives traders have been placing bullish bets on S. Such a trend is often associated with growing market confidence and bullish momentum, which could help extend the current rally. As such, Sonic appears positioned for a run toward $0.7, a support level it has failed to hold on multiple occasions since the start of the year. At press time, S was exchanging hands at $0.53 per coin. Read more: Aave expands DeFi reach with v3 launch on Sonic mainnet Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

The case has been closely monitored across the crypto space, as its outcome influences how U.S. regulators scrutinize blockchain projects. The SEC initially sued Ripple Labs in December 2020, alleging that the company had sold XRP as an unregistered security. Ripple, however, resisted the regulatory body’s claims, arguing that XRP did not meet security criteria. Following a mixed ruling in June 2023, the SEC escalated the matter by appealing the decision in early 2024. With the appeal withdrawn, Ripple finds itself in a stronger position to challenge any aspects of the case it deems unfavorable. Ripple Looks to the Future With the legal battle behind it, Ripple is shifting its focus toward business expansion. According to Alderoty, the resolution of the case allows the company to operate without the distraction of ongoing litigation. This is expected to accelerate Ripple’s efforts in the global cross-border payments sector. “With the SEC stepping back, Ripple is in full control, and we’ll determine the best course for our cross-appeal,” Alderoty stated.

Article 49: Bybit CEO: 88% of the stolen funds still traceable, 8% gone dark through crypto mixers
Content:
Bybit CEO Ben Zhou reported that 88% of the stolen funds from the exchange is still traceable, but hackers are ramping up obfuscation efforts with Bitcoin mixers. As of 20 March, Ben Zhou’s latest executive summary of Bybit’s stolen funds reveals that 88.87% of the stolen $1.4 billion worth of crypto is still traceable. Of this, 86.29%, equivalent to $1.23 billion, have been converted into 12,836 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and spread across 9,117 wallets, averaging 1.41 BTC each. According to Ben Zhou, the hackers started to use Bitcoin mixers to scramble the transaction history of the stolen funds. 3.20.25 Executive Summary on Hacked Funds: Hacker started to use BTC mixers: 1.

Ben Zhou said that this trend will likely grow as more funds are processed through mixers. Already, 7.59% have gone dark, meaning they cannot be traced anymore. Only 3.54% have been frozen as of the latest report . The first tranche of the stolen funds valued at $42.89 million was frozen in just one day thanks to the coordinated action of Tether, THORChain, ChangeNOW, FixedFloat, Avalanche, CoinEX, Bitget, and Circle. Additionally, Binance and Huobi exchanges froze some of the accounts linked to the stolen funds, based on intelligence provided by blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. Alongside the fund status update, Zhou reported that 63 of 5012 bounty reports submitted in the past month were deemed valid. He also reiterated plea for helping to decode mixer transactions, stating that it remains “the no.1 challenge” Bybit is facing right now. The live tracking of the stolen funds’ wallet addresses can be seen on the website launched by Bybit to help crowdsource fund recovery efforts. Individuals who provide intel that leads to freezing funds in those wallets will be rewarded with 5% of the value of the frozen funds as part of Bybit’s bounty program.

Article 50: After an End to Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit: Here’s What’s Next for the XRP Price in 2025
Content:
The post After an End to Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit: Here’s What’s Next for the XRP Price in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto markets were consolidating ahead of the FOMC but no sooner than the rates remained unchanged, the tokens gained strength. Moreover, the crypto space rejoiced when the Ripple CEO, Brad Gardlinghouse, announced the end of an ongoing lawsuit with the SEC. Meanwhile, he stated their fight to get back $125 million locked in escrow continues, which may also reach a closure soon. With the growing optimism about the next price action, the CEO makes 2 major claims. Firstly, he expects an XRP ETF to launch this year and secondly, he believes XRP could become part of the White House’s digital asset reserves. With this, the XRP price has surged past $2.5 and is testing the local resistance. However, the bears are restricting the rally but it may not be for more time as the price is at the foothill of a massive explosion. As seen in the above chart, the XRP price has surged past the descending trend line, which has attracted some bearish pressure. However, the rally remains above the gains, hinting towards an extended bullish action. On the other hand, the Ichimoku cloud is heading for a bullish crossover, as the bearish influence over the token fades. Meanwhile, the MACD is aiming to rise within a bullish range that could further offer enough boosts to the XRP price rally. Presently, the XRP price is holding the base line as a strong support, which is expected to trigger a strong rise soon. However, the token is required to rise and secure the resistance at $2.88, which may offer a strong base to keep up the momentum. Therefore, now that the price is just 28% away from it’s ATH at $3.85, the upcoming developments are expected to push the XRP price towards a new ATH .

Article 55: Arizona Leads Bitcoin Reserve Race As Two Bills Pass House Commerce Committee Vote
Content:
Arizona has taken the lead in the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) race after two bills passed the House of Representatives Commerce Committee vote on March 18. The state now has two active crypto reserve legislations and a legal tender bill, which have also advanced to the next stage. House Commerce Committee Passes Bitcoin Reserve Bills On Tuesday, the Arizona House Commerce Committee met to consider three Bitcoin-related legislations, including two strategic reserve bills, which passed the vote to advance to the next legislative stage. Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025), also known as the “Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act,” passed the vote with a 6 – 4 majority. Bitcoin Laws noted that the vote “was along partisan lines: Republicans for; Democrats against.” If passed, the legislation, sponsored by Republican Senator Wendy Rogers, would allow public funds in Arizona, such as the state treasurer or state retirement system, to invest up to 10% of their assets under management in cryptocurrencies, focusing on Bitcoin (BTC). “If the United States Secretary of the Treasury establishes a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the storage of government Bitcoin holdings, a public fund may store the virtual currency holdings of the public fund in a secure segregated account within the strategic Bitcoin reserve,” SB1025 reads. The bill also provides a framework for public funds to diversify their investments and establishes clear guidelines and definitions to manage them. Meanwhile, Senate Bill 1373 (SB1373), sponsored by Republican Senator Mark Finchem, passed with a 6 – 4 vote on Tuesday. The legislation aims to establish a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund in the state, comprised of seized cryptocurrencies and appropriated legislative funds that can be held through secure custody solutions or exchange-traded products (ETPs). The fund would be managed by the state treasurer, who could invest up to 10% of its total deposit in any fiscal year and may loan its assets to generate additional returns if it doesn’t increase the state’s financial risks. “The bill also outlines strict requirements for secure custody solutions, including exclusive key access, encrypted environments, hardware maintenance in multiple secure data centers, multi-party governance, comprehensive logging, regular security audits, and disaster recovery protocols,” Bitcoin Laws explains. Arizona Takes The SBR Lead After Utah scrapped its BTC reserve clause, Arizona became the state with the most advanced SBR legislation. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Utah State Senate exited the SBR race this month after amending the proposed bill allowing the state treasury to invest in digital assets. Following this development, Arizona took the lead with two reserve bills awaiting a final floor vote in the Senate before moving to the House Commerce Committee. Both strategic reserve bills now move to the House Rules Committee, which has a 5 – 3 Republican majority. If they pass the Rules Committee vote, SB1015 and SB1373 will only require a vote by the full House before heading to the governor’s desk. Similarly, another BTC-related bill passed the House Commerce Committee on Tuesday with a 6-4 vote and heads to the next stage. Senate Bill 1062 (SB1062), also sponsored by Senator Mark Finchem, aims to expand the state’s definition of legal tender to include cryptocurrencies, including BTC, alongside traditional currencies. The legislation also updates different sections of Arizona’s tax code to include the new legal tender definition and ensure consistency across different statutes, suggesting an effort to recognize the industry as a key sector.

Article 57: How Binance Could Fuel Next Solana Price Rally to $300
Content:
Solana price could be on the verge of a bullish breakout after on-chain data revealed that exchange giant Binance has been gradually accumulating SOL over the past month. As buying pressure increases, can Solana rally past $300 to a fresh all-time high? Binance Could Fuel The Next Solana Price Rally Popular analyst MartyParty has opined that Binance will drive the next Solana price rally. In his analysis, he compared Solana’s 50% pullback in March and Binance’s accumulation trend, which shows the exchange has heavily bought the dip. Data from Arkham supports the analyst’s outlook. It reveals that Binance’s Solana holdings have surged by 37% within one month from 16M SOL to the current balance of 22M SOL. Binance’s Solana holdings are now at their highest level since November 2024. Binance Solana Holdings On-chain analytics platform Glassnode also revealed that the recent decline in Solana price drove accumulation. It noted that after the price fell to $123 last week, traders bought 16.2M SOL . They also purchased 19M SOL at $126. This accumulation could offer support for SOL price between $123 and $126, preventing a prolonged downtrend. If this level holds, it will support a bullish Solana price forecast past $300. Can Solana Reach $300? Solana price today trades at $131 with a slight 1.5% gain in 24 hours. The altcoin has formed an ascending triangle pattern on its daily chart according to analyst Nebraskangooner. If the ongoing accumulation trend by Binance and long-term holders continues, SOL could break out from the upper trendline, which is also the 20-day EMA. If SOL overcomes the strong resistance at $137, it could continue with the uptrend toward the 50-day EMA at $158. However, a strong move to $300 will be confirmed if Solana price flips the 200-day EMA. The MACD indicator is also showing signs of more Solana price gains . The histogram bars are green, indicating an increase in buying activity. However, the bullish momentum is weak because the MACD remains negative. A strong uptrend will happen if this line crosses above the zero line. SOL/USD: 1-day Chart Besides the bullish technical outlook, today’s launch of the first SOL Futures ETF by Volatility Shares could also spark a bull run. Additionally, network activity on the Solana blockchain is rising again. Data from DappRadar shows that in the last 24 hours, dApp volumes on the network surged by more than 300% from $78M to $190M. The total transactions have also risen to 19.3M, which is the highest in more than a week. Solana dApp Volumes High network activity has always been a bullish catalyst for Solana price. If this continues as traders buy the dip, SOL can attain the $300 price target soon. The post How Binance Could Fuel Next Solana Price Rally to $300 appeared first on CoinGape .
Article 58: Bitcoin Options Soar After FED Meeting! What's the Latest on Ethereum Options? Here Are the Details
Content:
Bitcoin (BTC) investors are increasingly betting on price gains via options markets following the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting, while Ethereum (ETH) continues to see cautious sentiment reflecting ongoing uncertainty despite the upcoming network upgrade. BTC Options Rise After Fed Meeting The shift in sentiment came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reaffirmed the central bank's forecast of two rate cuts this year and downplayed the inflationary impact of tariffs implemented under the Trump administration, calling them “temporary.” Data from Amberdata shows that Bitcoin’s risk returns have turned positive, meaning traders are now paying a premium for call options (bullish bets) over put options (bearish bets). This marks a significant reversal from previous weeks, when downside fears fueled demand for protective put options. According to Paradigm, an institutional over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform, options flows have seen an increase in demand for call options on March 21 and March 28, while put options were sold off, suggesting that investors are positioning for a potential BTC rally in the coming weeks. The shift in the options market coincides with broader optimism for regulatory clarity in the crypto industry following the conclusion of the SEC’s legal battle with Ripple, which could have positive implications. Ethereum Options Lag as Investors Remain Cautious Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum’s options market continues to reflect a bias toward downside protection and still commands a premium over calls, particularly for contracts expiring in May. Despite the upcoming Ethereum Pectra update that is expected to increase network efficiency and scalability, traders remain hesitant. The update, which will introduce smart accounts, blob scaling, and validator improvements, is set to go live on March 26, but Ethereum has yet to see any notable changes in sentiment. *This is not investment advice.

Article 61: Urgent Crypto Alert: Lazarus Group’s Massive Bitcoin Conversion Exposes $1.4B Theft
Content:
Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The digital underworld has been buzzing with a revelation that sounds straight out of a spy thriller. Bybit exchange CEO, Ben Zhou, dropped a bombshell on X, exposing the audacious tactics of the notorious North Korean Lazarus Group. These cyber masterminds, linked to a staggering $1.4 billion cryptocurrency heist, have reportedly converted a whopping 86.29% of their ill-gotten gains into Bitcoin. Let’s dive deep into this unfolding saga and understand the implications for the crypto world. Unmasking the Lazarus Group’s Bitcoin Strategy Imagine this: a shadowy organization, suspected to be North Korea’s Lazarus Group, pilfering a colossal sum of cryptocurrency and then expertly maneuvering it through the intricate web of the blockchain. According to Bybit CEO Ben Zhou’s report, this is precisely what has transpired. Out of the 440,091 ETH stolen, a staggering 86.29% has been transformed into 12,836 BTC. This conversion, spread across a staggering 9,117 different wallets, paints a picture of a highly organized and sophisticated operation. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key figures: Total Stolen Funds (Initially in ETH): 440,091 ETH Percentage Converted to Bitcoin: 86.29% Bitcoin Acquired: 12,836 BTC Wallets Involved: 9,117 This data underscores the sheer scale and meticulous planning behind this cryptocurrency theft . The Lazarus Group’s ability to convert such a massive amount of Ethereum into Bitcoin without triggering immediate alarms speaks volumes about their operational prowess and the challenges faced in tracking and recovering stolen crypto assets. Why Bitcoin? The Preferred Choice for Cybercriminals? Why did the Lazarus Group choose Bitcoin as their primary conversion target? Several factors could be at play: Liquidity and Acceptance: Bitcoin is the most liquid and widely accepted cryptocurrency globally. Its robust trading volume across numerous exchanges makes it easier to move large sums without significantly impacting the market. Established Infrastructure: Bitcoin’s mature infrastructure and longer history provide a more established and perhaps perceived as less traceable network compared to newer or less established cryptocurrencies. Anonymity Features: While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, various techniques, including mixers and tumblers, can be employed to enhance anonymity, making it harder to trace the flow of funds. The choice of Bitcoin highlights a crucial aspect of cryptocurrency theft – the end goal isn’t just stealing the assets but also laundering them effectively. Converting to Bitcoin, a more established and liquid cryptocurrency, is a strategic move in this direction. Diving into the Murky Waters of Crypto Mixers The report further reveals a concerning trend: the Lazarus Group is increasingly leveraging crypto mixers like Wasabi to obfuscate the trail of their illicit gains. A significant 193 BTC has already been processed through these mixers. But what exactly are crypto mixers, and why are they a headache for law enforcement and blockchain analysts? Crypto mixers, also known as tumblers, are services designed to break the link between the sender and receiver of cryptocurrency transactions. They work by pooling together various transactions and mixing them, making it exceedingly difficult to trace the origin and destination of specific funds. Wasabi Wallet, specifically mentioned in the report, is a Bitcoin wallet known for its privacy features, including coin mixing capabilities. Challenges Posed by Crypto Mixers: Enhanced Anonymity: Mixers significantly enhance the anonymity of transactions, making it exponentially harder to track the flow of stolen funds. Decentralization: Many mixers operate in a decentralized or semi-decentralized manner, making it challenging to shut them down or regulate their activities. Technical Complexity: Decoding mixer transactions requires advanced blockchain analysis techniques and expertise, posing a significant hurdle for investigators. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou’s call for experts to help decode these mixer transactions underscores the gravity of the situation. Unraveling the complexities of mixer transactions is now the biggest challenge in recovering the remaining stolen funds. The Silver Lining: Traceability and Frozen Assets Despite the Lazarus Group’s sophisticated methods, there’s a glimmer of hope. The report indicates that a substantial 88.87% of the stolen funds remain traceable. This means that while the hackers have been active, a significant portion of the loot is still within reach, at least in theory. Furthermore, 3.54% of the stolen funds have already been frozen, demonstrating that efforts to track and seize these assets are yielding some results. Key Positives: High Traceability Rate: 88.87% traceability offers a significant window of opportunity for recovery efforts. Successful Freezing: The 3.54% of frozen funds is a testament to the effectiveness of current tracking and seizure mechanisms. Increased Awareness: Reports like this from Bybit CEO raise crucial awareness within the crypto community and among regulatory bodies, prompting collaborative action. However, the race against time is on. The longer these funds remain untraced and unrecovered, the greater the risk of them being fully laundered and disappearing into the digital ether. Actionable Insights and the Path Forward What can be learned from this high-profile North Korea hackers incident, and what steps can be taken to mitigate future risks? For Cryptocurrency Exchanges: Enhanced Security Measures: Continuously upgrade security protocols, including multi-signature wallets, cold storage, and robust intrusion detection systems. Advanced Transaction Monitoring: Implement sophisticated blockchain analytics tools to detect and flag suspicious transaction patterns, including those associated with known mixers. Collaboration and Information Sharing: Foster greater collaboration with blockchain analysis firms, law enforcement agencies, and other exchanges to share threat intelligence and best practices. For Cryptocurrency Users: Due Diligence: Exercise caution when interacting with new or unverified crypto platforms and services. Security Best Practices: Employ strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and use hardware wallets for storing significant crypto holdings. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest security threats and vulnerabilities in the crypto space. The Lazarus Group’s audacious Bitcoin conversion serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing battle between innovation and exploitation in the cryptocurrency realm. While the decentralized and borderless nature of crypto offers immense opportunities, it also presents unique challenges in combating illicit activities. The crypto community, regulatory bodies, and law enforcement agencies must work in concert to develop more effective strategies for preventing, detecting, and responding to sophisticated cyber threats like those posed by the Lazarus Group. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Crypto World The revelation by Bybit CEO Ben Zhou is more than just a news update; it’s a urgent wake-up call for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Lazarus Group’s sophisticated tactics, particularly their adept use of Bitcoin conversion and crypto mixers, underscore the evolving nature of cybercrime in the digital age. While the high traceability rate and frozen assets offer a sliver of hope, the challenge of decoding mixer transactions remains a significant hurdle. The crypto world must heed this warning and double down on collaborative efforts to enhance security, improve transaction monitoring, and develop innovative solutions to stay one step ahead of these determined cyber adversaries. The fight against cryptocurrency theft is far from over, and vigilance is our strongest weapon.

Article 64: European equity funds see largest 4-week inflows of the decade as interest shifts from U.S. stocks
Content:
European equity funds recorded the largest four-week inflows in nearly the past 10 years, with European stocks outperforming U.S. stocks. European stocks are also seeing the latest weekly inflows recorded since February 2022, before the Russia-Ukraine war began. The surge is due to rising expectations that European governments will pour more funding into defense and infrastructure amid the U.S.’s pullback of its support for Ukraine. Bank of America Corp. data further revealed that money market funds attracted over $50 billion, gold attracted over $1 billion, stocks drew in over $22 billion, and bonds attracted over $12 billion. Emerging markets and technology stocks contributed to the large inflows experienced over the past few weeks. Passive fund inflows into European markets have further hit over $6 billion, marking the 10th consecutive week of inflows. Active funds have still seen more outflows this week, losing over $1.2 billion and marking the 43rd consecutive week of outflows. The funds have lost over $11 billion year-to-date. BofA strategist Michael Hartnett suggested that the current trend seen in European equity funds could continue to outperform U.S. funds, including the Stoxx 600 outperforming the S&P 500. BofA also mentioned that more investors expected European stocks and funds to maintain their strength throughout the year. The bank’s latest Fund Manager Survey indicated that 60% of investors believed in the positive health of European money markets and a sharp sentiment shift from U.S. markets. The survey also pointed out that the current sentiment shift from the U.S. to European markets is the sharpest rotation seen since 1999. 39% of investors currently hold overweight positions in European funds, compared to 12% recorded last month. 23% of investors also reported underweight positions in U.S. stocks, compared to 17% holding overweight positions last month. U.S. stocks may continue to underperform in the coming months The U.S. money markets have been struggling in the first months of President Trump’s administration due to the economic policies now viewed as less-than-favorable. The BofA survey indicated that investors were dumping the U.S. stocks at the fastest rate ever seen, supported by the recent 40-percent-point reduction in investors’ hold on long positions on U.S. stocks. The downturn has benefited other regions, especially Europe and China. Market indices for the U.S. money markets have also been underperforming, with the Nasdaq Industrial Composite, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Index all dropping over the past few weeks. The indices saw recovery during the weekend for the first time in several weeks but opened lower on Monday as investors failed to maintain the upward momentum. The reversed momentum has also raised speculation that more Wall Street sell-offs are to be expected in the near future. Deutsche Bank chief strategist Bankhim Chadha recently mentioned that there would be more sell-offs in U.S. equities before the indices recovered, stating the possibility of the S&P 500 recovering by 24%. Morgan Stanley’s chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, also mentioned that there would not be a sustainable rally for a while. The Fund Manager Survey revealed that 69% of fund managers believed that U.S. stock exceptionalism was ending. The sentiment has also created concerns that U.S. stocks will continue to underperform in the coming months. Goldman Sachs analyst Peter Oppenheimer recently warned that U.S. capital markets had shifted from high to moderate performance. Oppenheimer further commented on the current shift toward other regions’ funds, adding that Trump’s policies could drive the shift further. European active ETFs receive more attention from ETF investors The ongoing economic concerns in the U.S. have also shifted ETF investors from U.S.-based ETFs to European active ETFs. The European active ETFs industry is projected to grow to over $1 trillion in assets under management in the coming years. Wall Street asset management firms, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sach Asset Management, and BlackRock Inc., have expressed interest in launching active ETFs on European exchanges. European Ucits ETFs have also seen a surge in inflows in the past month, with over 33 billion euros flowing into the funds, marking a 16% increase compared to January. U.S.-based crypto ETFs have seen massive outflows over the past few weeks following the continued economic uncertainty in the country. U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs shed $5.5 billion in the past 5 weeks, with Trump’s tariffs driving investors away from riskier assets. The massive outflows notably began after Trump’s entry into office in January, with recent crypto-friendly news failing to drive interest in the ETFs. Cryptocurrencies have also been underperforming, with CryptoQuant’s Ki Young Ju recently suggesting that the bull run was over.

Article 65: BTC, ETH, XRP Price Prediction as S&P 500 Index Rockets, Gold Hits ATH
Content:
Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) prices rose modestly on Thursday after Jerome Powell’s transitory statement on inflation. BTC price retested the important resistance at $86,000, while ETH rose to $2,000 and XRP price hit $2.5. So, how will these blue-chip crypto market coins react as the S&P 500 index and gold prices surge? S&P 500 Index and Gold Prices Are Soaring Popular players in the crypto market, like BTC, ETH, and XRP may benefit from the ongoing surge of other risky assets. The S&P 500 index, which tracks the biggest US companies, rose to $5,700, up by over 3% from the lowest point this month. Popular American indices like the Dow Jones and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 have also jumped. At the same time, gold price has continued surging this year and is sitting at its all-time high. It has jumped in the last three consecutive weeks, making it one of the year’s best-performing assets. US stocks and gold continued rising after the Fed interest rate decision . The bank decided to leave interest rates unchanged and hinted that it would start tapering its quantitive tightening (QT) process. Most notably, Jerome Powell said that Trump tariff would cause transitory inflation, meaning that the bank would consider delivering more rate cuts this year. Mohamed El-Erian blasted that view, saying : “ I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility . It’s simply too early to say with any regress of confidence that the inflationary effects will be transitory.” The soaring S&P 500 index and gold prices are bullish for crypto prices like BTC, ETH, and XRP since these assets have some correlation. BTC Price Technical Analysis While the ongoing S&P 500 index and gold price rally is positive for the BTC price, technicals point to uncertainties ahead. The main risk is that Bitcoin price has formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages crossed each other. Bitcoin has also formed a rising wedge, which is made up of two ascending and converging trendlines. It often leads to a bearish breakout. As CoinGape wrote earlier, Bitcoin key liquidation levels point to more downside. If this happens, the most likely scenario is where BTC price crashes to $73,587, the highest point in March last year. BTC price Chart ETH Price Technical Analysis While ETH price has bounced back from the lowest point this month, it remains below the important resistance point at $2,138. This is a crucial level since it was the neckline of the triple-top pattern at $4,000. The bearish ETH price forecast will remain as long as it is below that resistance level and the 50-day moving average at $2,300. More downside will be confirmed Ethereum price drops below $1,763. ETH Price Chart XRP Price Technical Analysis Ripple price rose after the end of the SEC vs Ripple case . However, it is notable that the coin has struggled to move above the resistance at $3, which is its make-or-break level. A clear bullish outlook will be confirmed if it rises above that level since it is the right and left shoulders of the head and shoulders pattern. Therefore, there is a risk that it will resume the downtrend as investors sell the fact. A drop to $1 will be confirmed if it crashes below $1.9, the neckline. XRP price chart Summary The crypto market, US stocks, and gold prices rose after the Fed decision. However, crypto prices like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP may struggle to sustain those gains, leading to an eventual crash.

Article 67: Chainlink (LINK) on the Brink: Critical Levels to Watch Now
Content:
Chainlink (LINK) is struggling with volatility, trading at $14.46 after a failed breakout at $15.17. The price initially climbed within an ascending triangle on the 1-hour chart but faced sharp rejection at resistance, triggering a pullback. Now, LINK is testing the $14.40 support zone, a key battleground for buyers. Key Levels to Watch A drop below $14.40 could accelerate selling, pushing LINK toward $14.20. Losing this level may break the ascending triangle’s trendline support, shifting momentum bearish and increasing downside risk. If buyers defend $14.40, a rebound toward $15.17 is likely. A breakout above this resistance would reverse the failed breakout, turning sentiment bullish. If momentum builds, LINK could target $17.40, a critical resistance for confirming a larger uptrend. Breakout Potential A decisive move above $17.40 could spark a long-term rally , attracting more buyers and strengthening market confidence. This scenario would favor both short-term traders and long-term holders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Outlook The fight at $14.40 will dictate LINK’s next move.

Article 70: Has Bitcoin Really Entered a Bear Market? Analyst Weighs In
Content:
Bitcoin’s recent price movement has sparked debate among analysts over whether the original cryptocurrency has entered a bear market. Renowned analyst Ali Martinez recently shared an in-depth analysis assessing Bitcoin’s (BTC) trend using multiple technical indicators and on-chain data. In his study, Martinez suggested that while BTC might be shifting into a bearish phase, certain factors could still support a recovery. Key Indicators Signal Bearish Momentum First, Martinez highlighted the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse, a metric tracking Bitcoin movement between spot and derivative exchanges. According to the analyst, BTC is currently in a “corrective phase,” often marked by declining prices or stabilization after a strong rally. Bitcoin has corrected 23% from its peak of over $109,000 in late January during President Donald Trump’s inauguration. He also pointed to the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Ratio, which has turned negative—a historical signal of weakening momentum. Additionally, his Market Cycle Indicator suggests that Bitcoin could be in the early stages of a bear market, aligning with past downturns. Further evidence comes from large investor activity, particularly among miners and whales. On-chain data shared by Martinez showed that miners recently sold over $27 million in bitcoin profits, which often signals a shift toward caution in the market. Meanwhile, whale activity shows that major BTC holders have liquidated more than $260 million, adding to overall selling pressure. Compounding these concerns is a sharp decline in capital inflows—new investments entering Bitcoin. Monthly inflows have dropped significantly from $135 billion in December 2024 to just $4 billion on March 18, 2025, indicating weaker demand and a potential lack of fresh buying power. Can Bitcoin Hold Key Support Levels? Despite these bearish signals, Martinez identified key support levels that could stabilize Bitcoin’s price. According to the analyst, the $66,000–$69,000 range has emerged as a crucial zone where buyers might step in. To back this, Martinez shared a chart from IntoTheBlock that shows that 750,000 investors purchased 313,000 BTC around the $69,000 price range. He also shared Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution, which suggests strong support near $69,354—further reinforcing the idea that Bitcoin could find a floor in this range. Moreover, he pointed out that the Mayer Multiple and Bitcoin’s position relative to its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) suggests $66,000 as another critical level to watch. However, Martinez mentioned a potential bullish scenario tied to global liquidity. According to his analysis, rising liquidity levels have historically helped BTC recover, pointing to April as a possible turning point. If the leading crypto asset manages to reclaim $93,700 as support, it could signal a renewed uptrend, with a potential move toward $111,000, Martinez said. Despite these bearish concerns, BTC surged 4% to enter a 10-day high of $85,900 following the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady.

Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Asian investors are shifting from Tron and Binance Coin to newer projects. XYZVerse, a rising sports memecoin with explosive growth potential, is capturing investor attention. Table of Contents XYZVerse: Could this memecoin deliver 50x returns? Tron stagnates Binance Coin fluctuates Conclusion Prominent investors in Asia are reportedly offloading significant holdings of Tron and Binance Coin. At the same time, a lot of attention has shifted to an obscure altcoin priced at a fraction of a cent, which is rumored to have massive growth potential. This unexpected move is stirring curiosity in the crypto community as the details behind this hidden gem begin to emerge. XYZVerse: Could this memecoin deliver 50x returns? The excitement around XYZVerse isn’t just noise; it’s a genuine phenomenon. As the pioneering all-sports meme token, XYZVerse is rapidly bridging the gap between sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, sparking major interest. Unlike typical memecoins that thrive solely on fleeting trends, XYZVerse is carving out its own niche. By merging the exhilarating world of sports with the contagious energy of meme culture, XYZVerse has captured significant momentum. The presale is accelerating, allowing early adopters to secure tokens at prices far below their anticipated future value. Currently, XYZVerse remains in its presale stage, but investor demand is already high. The token’s price has impressively surged from an initial $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, and over 70% of the $15 million presale target has been achieved. With a final projected presale price of $0.1, early participants are set for significant returns. XYZVerse’s popularity is evident on CoinMarketCap, where the community sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. With a remarkable 95% of voters forecasting further growth for XYZ, optimism is undeniably high. Influential crypto figures have also noticed XYZVerse’s potential. Crypto influencer DanjoCapitalMaster, who boasts nearly 800,000 followers, recently labeled XYZVerse as a “moonshot opportunity.” While the crypto market always involves risks, the buzz surrounding XYZVerse is undeniably strong. Beyond mere speculation, XYZVerse boasts structured and sustainable tokenomics. A significant 15% allocation to liquidity ensures robust market foundations, while another 10% is set aside for community rewards through airdrops and bonuses. Additionally, a substantial 17.13% of the supply is earmarked for deflationary burns, potentially enhancing token scarcity and value. What truly distinguishes XYZVerse is its emphasis on community involvement. Through initiatives like the Ambassador Program, supporters can earn tokens by actively promoting the project. Furthermore, discussions with prominent sports celebrities are underway, aiming to amplify XYZVerse’s visibility. By uniting passionate sports communities with the dynamic crypto ecosystem, XYZVerse is crafting an engaging and entertaining experience. Backed by a rapidly growing presale, enthusiastic community, and ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse possesses all the elements of a memecoin poised for explosive growth. While crypto markets are inherently unpredictable, savvy investors recognize the opportunity to participate early in a potentially promising project. With the presale window rapidly closing, the time to explore XYZVerse might be now.

Over the last month, it dipped by 3.93%. Looking at the past six months, TRX surged by 53.66%, showing strong growth over time. Currently, TRX trades between $0.20 and $0.23. The 10-day moving average is $0.24, while the 100-day average is $0.22. This places the price below the short-term average but above the long-term one. The Relative Strength Index stands at 55.83, indicating a neutral market stance. The MACD level is 0.0037, hinting at slight bullish momentum. The nearest resistance level is $0.25. If TRX breaks through, it could reach $0.27, which is about a 17% increase from current levels. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.19. If the price falls below this, it might drop to $0.17, roughly a 13% decrease. With the stochastic at 50.57, the market seems balanced. TRX could move upward if buying interest grows. Binance Coin fluctuates BNB has shown mixed performance recently. In the past week, its price jumped by 11.81%, indicating short-term bullishness. However, over the last month, it declined by 8.29%. Over six months, there’s an overall increase of 8.81%, reflecting moderate long-term growth. Trading between $532.97 and $647.57, BNB is approaching the nearest resistance at $692.63. A break above this could target the second resistance at $807.23, implying a potential gain of around 25%. If the price falls below the support at $463.43, it might drop to $348.83, representing a decrease of about 35%. Technical indicators are sending cautious signals. The RSI is at 39.37, nearing oversold territory, suggesting a possible rebound. The Stochastic indicator is low at 20.51, also pointing to overselling. However, the MACD level is negative at -3.1273, indicating bearish momentum. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages are close, showing a lack of clear trend direction. Based on these factors, BNB’s future movement is uncertain, but a significant breakout could occur soon.

Article 74: Ethereum Sepolia Testnet Faces Issues—Is DuragDoge the Real Winner of This Shift?
Content:
The post Ethereum Sepolia Testnet Faces Issues—Is DuragDoge the Real Winner of This Shift? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum (ETH) is on a prolonged downward trend, causing crypto users to wonder what is happening with the market’s second-largest crypto. Ethereum’s dip has incurred significant losses for its holders, with about 70% of ETH addresses clearly out of money. The token is plunging even deeper despite the network’s activity, such as the Pectra upgrade deployed on the Sepolia testnet to increase ETH’s worth. Despite the bear market, DuragDoge ($DURAG) is the real winner right now. Its features equip it with the resilience and longevity it needs to beat market conditions, so analysts rank it as the best cryptocurrency. The $DURAG token is among the best crypto pre-sales right now, and it continues to hit new records with its utility-driven features. Read on to discover why $DURAG is ten steps ahead in the game. Ethereum (ETH) Still in the Dip as its New Upgrade on Sepolia Testnet Faces Issues Ethereum’s most anticipated upgrade, Pectra , was deployed on its final testnet on March 5. The upgrade marks a significant milestone towards Ethereum’s goal of achieving the mainnet activation. Pectra has received immense support from community members, who hope the upgrade will boost ETH’s value. The upgrade also aims to improve Ethereum’s network activity and scalability. However, Pectra has yet to live up to its promises, as the developers encounter a hurdle on the Sepolia testnet. Tim Beiko , Ethereum Protocol Support Lead, said the problem is due to a custom deposit contract on Sepolia. This caused execution layer (EL) clients to face issues such as transaction delays within blocks. With this issue onboard, the mainnet activation launch date might be postponed, killing token holders’ hopes. This also means the ETH token might continue to plummet, as the upgrade was supposed to cause ETH to rally. The dip is affecting investors and token holders, as data from IntoTheBlock shows only about 26% of ETH addresses are making slight profits. This means that over 70% of Ethereum addresses have lost everything. No wonder holders are shifting to $DURAG, one of the best crypto coins to invest in. DuragDoge ($DURAG) Rallies, Emerges as the New Token With the Highest Potential DuragDoge is the new hot deal in the crypto market. It tops the chart as the best cryptocurrency to buy now. DuragDoge is a new meme coin with revolutionary features that will shake the meme coin sector. Its token, $DURAG, is fortified with features that will promote the hustle culture, reflect members’ identity and creativity, drape members with the ultimate drip, and promote longevity. DuragDoge is headed for the global stage while creating an ecosystem that supports staking and other developments that benefit token holders. These features place $DURAG many steps ahead of other meme coins, which is why it is currently recording one of the best crypto presales. $DURAG’s presales aim to give everyone early access to this golden token. This is why 1,240,000,000 $DURAG tokens are available at exclusive rates. The $DURAG token is gathering interest from crypto whales and users as it is one of the best crypto coins to invest in. DuragDoge ($DURAG) Gains Whales’ Approval With its Reward Features The $DURAG token is gaining widespread adoption due to its reward features that increase holders’ gains. One of $DURAG’s most profitable features is the staking and reward. Holders who stake their $DURAGs will earn up to 20% APY in rewards, boosting their portfolios significantly. There will be community incentives, where members receive rewards for their activeness and creativity in DuragDoge’s ecosystem. There will also be periodic burns to assure holders and investors of $DURAG’s security and longevity. These burns will regulate $DURAG’s circulation, making it a deflationary token whose value will continue to rise. Conclusion With many changes in the crypto market, DuragDoge might be the new leading crypto. The $DURAG token continues to see increased adoption, with the presales surging beyond expectations. You might not want to mix out on this drip, so join the presales right now to start enjoying gains! Follow Durag Doge on X and Telegram for the latest news and updates. Visit Durag Doge Presale

Article 76: Are Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) Staging a Comeback? Top 3 Memecoins Analyzed
Content:
The entire crypto market cap (excluding BTC) is up around 14% since a potential bottom was hit last week. Memecoins have also taken part in this recovery. The top 3 memecoins by market cap are analysed. Are $DOGE, $SHIB, and $PEPE making a comeback? Total2 will signal altcoin rally or rejection Source: TradingView Total2 is the chart of the combined market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies, excluding $BTC. Therefore it enables a reasonable assessment of how the altcoins are doing in general. It can be seen that a minor rally is currently taking place. For this rally to really take off, the descending trendline will have to be broken, and higher highs will need to be made. If this does take place, expect some of the prominent memecoins to take advantage. $DOGE potentially finds a bottom Source: TradingView The daily chart for $DOGE does show that this $25.5 billion memecoin may have finally found a bottom. The price was able to bounce from the ascending trendline, which was perhaps the very bottom, and is now battling to stay above the 0.786, the deepest of the Fibonacci retracement levels. A big plus is that the bulls have broken through the descending trendline. The price may be coming back down to retest this, possibly at $0.16 before going higher. If the bottom is indeed in for $DOGE, potential bounces from the indicators in the RSI, and Stochastic RSI, could help to get a powerful rally started. $SHIB in favourable position Source: TradingView The $SHIB price does look to be in a favourable position in the weekly chart. The bulls have forced it through the descending trendline, and the price is currently maintaining at the major horizontal support level. With the Stochastic RSI indicators on this time frame inclining upward from the bottom, all would appear to be perfect for a rally from here. That said, the support and the trendline would have to hold, and Bitcoin would need to take the lead. Important targets are at $0.000016, and then $$0.000021. Horizontal support proves its worth for $PEPE Source: TradingView $PEPE can probably be classed as a true memecoin, because all it has backing it is the air that we breathe. Even so, it has a market cap of more than $3 billion, and the price appears to be recovering nicely so far. The horizontal support at $0.000006 has proved its worth, and the price has bounced from there. Targets, according to the Fibonacci levels, are in the chart above.

Content:
Pi Network struggles to break $1.20 resistance despite a bullish price trend. Falling trading volume raises concerns about PI’s short-term market momentum. Exchange resistance and KYC deadline add uncertainty to PI’s price outlook. Pi Network (PI) has shown some fight in its recent price action, but it’s heading into a critical resistance level around March 21st. Right now, the token sits at $1.18 , which is a 4.79% jump over the last 24 hours. Even with this price bump, the amount of PI traded in the last 24 hours has dropped by a significant 32.90% to $361.2 million. This dip in trading activity might mean that market players are being a bit cautious. On the other hand, the total value of all PI out there (market cap) has risen by 4.34% to $8.06 billion, suggesting that overall investor confidence is still holding up. Key Levels for PI Traders to Watch For traders keeping an eye on PI, there are some important price levels to note.

Approximately $18 million in shorts were liquidated over the last 24 hours. SOL’s strengthening technicals target is $220. Launch of Solana futures ETF boosts SOL price Today’s debut of Solana futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) by Volatility Shares has injected fresh enthusiasm into SOL investors. 🚨 BREAKING: The first-ever Solana futures ETFs are launching tomorrow. Volatility Shares is debuting two ETFs: • SOLZ: Tracks Solana futures • SOLT: Offers 2x leveraged exposure pic.twitter.com/Wt2gt6oBPc — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 19, 2025 Key takeaways: Volatility Shares, a US-based investment firm, is set to launch the first-ever Solana futures ETFs on Thursday, March 20. A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reveals that two Solana-based ETFs issued by Volatility Shares ETFs will begin trading on Thursday, March 20. These include Solana ETF (SOLZ), which will track Solana futures and the Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT), which offers leveraged exposure. SOLZ will have a management fee of 0.95%, while traders will be charged 1.85% for SOLT. The ETFs, following a path similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures products, signal growing institutional acceptance and provide easier access for traditional investors. Market participants believe that the launch of these funds could be significant in the approval of a spot Solana ETF . Several issuers, including Grayscale , Franklin Templeton and VanEck , have applied for spot Solana ETFs, which are yet to be approved by the SEC. Bloomberg ETF analysts believe there is a 75% chance of approval by this year’s end. Analysts see this as a regulatory green light, boosting confidence in Solana and across the broader market. “​​Solana ETF dropping right after BTC/ETH ETFs? The TradFi gates are opening wide,” said crypto analyst Kolin in a March 19 post on X. “Futures are just the start - spot ETF inevitable. $SOL's just warming up and the Solana ecosystem’s about to get flooded with institutional liquidity.” “This is wild,” asserted Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas in response to the developments, adding that it is probably a good sign as Solana futures “arguably bode well for spot ETF odds.” Short liquidations push SOL price higher Solana’s price rise on March 20 is accompanied by significant liquidations in the derivatives market, according to data from CoinGlass. The crypto futures market witnessed the liquidation of over $359 million worth of leverage positions in the last 24 hours, with $258.7 million being short liquidations. Over $18.64 million short SOL positions have been liquidated against $3 million long liquidations over the same period. Total crypto liquidations.

Furthermore, the SOL price gains accompany a recovery in its funding rates . SOL’s 8-hour funding rates have flipped positive from -0.0050% on March 19 to 0.0049% on March 20, as shown in the chart below. SOL funding rates performance. Source: CoinGlass A rise in funding rates indicates increased demand for long positions and increased interest among SOL traders. Related: ‘I am ashamed’ — Solana CEO breaks silence over controversial ad backlash Can SOL price stage a recovery to $220? SOL still trades well below its range high of $220 reached on Feb. 5. However, the bulls have established support around $110 and $125 at the upper boundary of a descending channel. The daily relative strength index (RSI) has recorded higher highs since March 10 with no divergence, indicating that the upward momentum remains strong. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The next immediate barrier sits at $140, which, if broken, SOL price would rise higher to confront resistance from the $165 to $190 supply zone—this is around where all the major moving averages sit. Bulls will be required to flip this area into support to increase the chances of rising toward $220, where the price could pause for a while. According to analyst Cryptobits, SOL’s recent low at $112 marked the local bottom for the altcoin. He added that Solana’s fundamentals remain strong, with increasing “investment interests from institutions” supporting its upside. “With all the above remaining intact, I see $SOL returning above $200 and eventually breaking its ATH high at $296.” This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Article 83: Fired Democrat FTC commissioner warns of the ‘corrupting influence of billionaires’
Content:
Former Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya believes President Donald Trump’s decision to fire the agency’s two remaining Democratic members serves the interests of powerful billionaires rather than the American people. Speaking before the Colorado state legislature Wednesday, Bedoya said the dismissals would suppress fair market oversight and undermine the work of independent regulatory agencies. “ I think we need to be focused on the billionaires over President Trump’s shoulder at his inauguration and what this attempt will do for them ,” Bedoya said. “ Above all else, we need to be asking ourselves, who will win from this attempt to illegally remove us, and frankly, who will lose? ” Bedoya: Trump firing Democratic party-aligned commissioners is illegal As reported by Cryptopolitan on March 19, Bedoya and fellow Democratic Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter were fired on Tuesday evening, an action they have coined “illegal and unlawful.” Their removal appears to violate legal precedent that restricts a president from firing FTC commissioners without cause. The following day, in a CNBC interview, Slaughter cautioned that the dismissals breach government agencies’ ability to work independently. “ This isn’t just about the FTC, and it’s not about my job ,” Slaughter said on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street . “ This is about policing the ability of the FTC to police markets and ensure honest businesses are protected instead of allowing companies that lie and cheat to get ahead. ” Slaughter also asked if the firings could be extended to other independent agencies or if it was just a ploy to take out the liberals from the agency. “ If I can be fired, I don’t know why Jerome Powell can’t be fired ,” referring to the Federal Reserve chairman. “ As head of the executive branch, President Trump is vested with all of the executive power in our government ,” said FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson, defending Trump’s decision. “I have no doubts about his constitutional authority to remove Commissioners, which is necessary to ensure democratic accountability for our government. ” Washington has not specified the reasons for the dismissals, but White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Trump is exercising his “lawful authority” to manage personnel. “ President Trump will continue to rid the federal government of bad actors unaligned with his common sense agenda the American people decisively voted for ,” Rogers remarked. Is Trump protecting his tech friends? Bedoya asserted that his firing may be linked to his statements on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Bezos, along with other tech executives such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, stood behind Trump at his inauguration on January 20. “ I issued a statement criticizing Mr Bezos for working his people and warehouses so fast, so hard that they literally have to put up vending machines on the warehouse floor, dispensing and capping the amount of painkillers each of those workers has to get, ” Bedoya told Colorado lawmakers. Mr. Bezos, when I think about “free markets and personal liberties” I don’t think about the Post editorial page. I think about this vending machine in an Amazon Fulfillment Center, which is stocked not with chips but with painkillers. https://t.co/emxXutsDzP pic.twitter.com/R1pMOHz3Aj — Alvaro Bedoya (@BedoyaFTC) February 28, 2025 Although he didn’t directly accuse Bezos of having influenced his dismissal, Bedoya said the timing of his firing was “interesting.” “ I’m not alleging that this was why I was fired, but I think it’s an interesting coincidence .” The FTC has also been investigating Amazon, Meta, and X, which the ex-commissioner revealed he had been working on. “ I stress an uncomfortable fact, which is that the issue of the corrupting influence of money in politics, I don’t think, is limited to one party . So I think we need to take a step back and ask ourselves, who will win from this effort to remove us? ” he inquired. Bipartisan concerns and the Senate pushback More than two dozen Democratic senators have called on Trump to reinstate the fired commissioners. In a letter signed on Tuesday by Senators Amy Klobuchar, Dick Durbin, and Maria Cantwell, among others, they argued that Trump is ignoring the FTC’s independence. “ This action contradicts Congress’s constitutional authority to create bipartisan, independent commissions and upends more than 110 years of work at the FTC to protect consumers from deceptive practices and monopoly power, ” the senators wrote. “ We urge you to rescind these dismissals so the FTC can get back to the people’s work .” Still, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt swatted away concerns about any legal repercussions, saying the removals were well within the US president’s authority. “ They were given ample notice in a letter that I believe your outlet reported on, ” Leavitt reckoned. When asked if the administration’s goal was to overturn the 1935 Supreme Court ruling that protects the independence of commissions, she responded, “ The goal was to let these individuals go. If we have to fight it all the way to the Supreme Court, we certainly will. ” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Article 84: Bitlayer has finally bridged BitVM to the world stage
Content:
Co-founders Charlie Hu and Kevin He started Bitlayer as a research-oriented passion project based on the BitVM paradigm, quickly spearheading the effort into an opportunity to unlock immense liquidity in the Bitcoin asset and ecosystem. Funnelling their extensive experience leading international teams to global success at Polygon, Polkadot, and Huobi, the two turned Bitlayer into the most relevant Bitcoin L2 in the space. In July 2024, Bitlayer announced its $11M Series A round led by Franklin Templeton and ABCDE. By October of the same year the team had raised an extended Series A round securing $9M more in funding, this time led by Polychain Capital. In less than a year’s time following the raise announcements, the team at Bitlayer has made staggering progress. Since the launch of its V1 mainnet, the project reached an all-time high TVL of 850 million with over 200 Dapps launched on the L2. Bitlayer’s ecosystem is growing and thriving with projects building Bitcoin DeFi (BTC-Fi) applications, ranging from BTC dexes, staking, restaking and liquid staking, infra, oracles, interoperability, data availability, and runes and ordinals, amongst many others. Recently, the team announced the first BitVM bridge solution testnet built in the Bitcoin ecosystem. “The bridge is an absolute necessity for Defi to happen on Bitcoin, ” said Charlie Hu, Co-founder of Bitlayer. “The main differentiator when compared to previous solutions is the trust assumption. The existing multisig set-up requires the majority of signers to be honest; if it happens that the majority of signers are malicious then the bridge becomes insecure, which is what happened during some of the major hacks we’ve seen lately in the space. Our bridging solution is trust-minimized which means that only one signer needs to be honest in order for the bridge to be secure.” The BitVM trust-minimized bridge enables the flow of bitcoin to an array of blockchains and decentralized applications. The recent announcement of Bitlayer’s partnerships with key Layer 1 blockchains such as Base, Arbitrum, Starknet, Sonic SVM, and Plume Network signal rising demand and interest. Now, with the imminent launch of Bitlayer Mainnet V2 in Q2 2025, Bitlayer is finally bringing BitVM to the world stage. “ T he Bitlayer network’s Mainnet V2 is set to transition to a Bitcoin Rollup, a first-of-its-kind innovation in the market, bringing Bitcoin-level security to the Layer 2 ecosystem,” says Kevin He, Bitlayer Co-founder. BitVM allows for trust-minimized deployment of Bitcoin into a host of blockchains, DeFi protocols, and decentralized applications in order to earn yield, staking rewards, lending and borrowing features, and much more. The BitVM paradigm does not require a fork to the Bitcoin protocol, and instead provides a technical solution built with zero-knowledge proofs, rollup architecture, and trust-minimized bridging. Institutional investors, OGs, whales, traders, and holders can deploy their Bitcoin to earn yield rewards, in a non-custodial, trust-minimized way. And so Bitlayer continues its vision to untap Bitcoin’s full Defi potential, teaming up with clients, community, and ecosystem partners to make history for Bitcoin.

Article 85: Uranium Digital Raises $6.1M to Speed Debut of Crypto-Powered Spot Market
Content:
Alex Dolesky thought his startup's push to "financialize" the sleepy uranium spot market would be a hit as nuclear energy stages a global comeback. All that tokenized yellowcake's looking more like gold. Months after netting its first $1.7 million from venture investors, Uranium Digital raised another $6.1 million in a seed round led by Framework Ventures. The financing will accelerate Uranium Digital's buildout of a spot trading platform for uranium that uses crypto infrastructure on the backend. It claims to be the first institutional market — crypto-powered or not — for a critical clean-energy commodity that, perplexingly, doesn't enjoy the same easy trading of its dirtier peers, coal, natural gas and oil. A radioactive mix of high regulations and low mainstream demand previously stymied the emergence of a robust uranium spot market, Dolesky said in an interview. While the strict rules over who can take settlement of yellowcake, a powdered form of uranium oxide concentrate, aren't going anywhere, the global demand for nuclear energy is taking care of the rest. Nuclear power is on its comeback tour. The energy source once derided by unfortunate disasters — most recently the Fukushima meltdown — is cropping up as a salve for rapidly increasing electric needs. The surge is fueling newfound interest from investors and institutions for an accessible spot market. In crypto Dolesky said he's found an efficient avenue to create the first. He says he's "abstracting away" the usual pain points of on-chain trading so that Uranium Digital will look and feel familiar for institutional clients. "Crypto rails for efficiency, speed and execution purposes — it's a unique opportunity," he said. As the platform nears its launch date Dolesky plans to pour more capital into his business and engineering teams. He realized after the pre-seed that the company's proposed solution had an even deeper well of potential users than what he called his most optimistic projections. Meeting the excess demand meant moving faster and raising more money. "The response we've gotten from the traditional market has been such that we're effectively going live sooner than anticipated," he said.

Best USA Coins To Buy Now Ahead of Crypto Summit Speech At the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit in New York, President Donald Trump will provide a recorded communication.

Among the USA coins to purchase are XRP, ADA, LINK, and SOL. Tweet Ripple (XRP) XRP price is among the top USA coins to buy after a strong market recovery. XRP token experienced a surge of over 10% during the day and emerged among the highest performers of the day.

After the Federal Open Market Committee decision on previous day, Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced positive market trends. XRP continues to capture attention from market participants as Trump prepares to address the crypto summit which drives investors to consider its potential influence on the market. Source: TradingView Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) experienced a 5% increase during the past day which lifted its value to $0.7327. The ADA crypto follows an upward trend which shows growing strength because it aims to reach $1.

The most recent data shows Cardano (ADA) experienced substantial growth in its trading volume. Within the recent 24-hour period, whales purchased 190 million ADA tokens.

Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) enters a positive direction with US investors seeing their first Solana ETFs debut today. The price of Solana has rebounded while trading over the crucial $130 support threshold. SOL has achieved a 10% rise in value throughout the past 24 hours making it one of the prime USA coins to purchase at present. Investors show intense attention to this market development since they believe it represents substantial expansion possibilities. The Solana derivatives market continues to expand rapidly based on CoinGlass data. The total volume has expanded by 81.02% to achieve $8.63 billion. Open interest increased by 2.26% while reaching $3.86 billion and the change matches the current statistics. The rising market participation levels have led to increased trading volume and interest which might impact Solana’s price volatility. Source- Coinglass Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink price is among the top USA coins to buy after a notable recovery over the past 24 hours. The LINK price followed the crypto market bullish trend after the FOMC decision on the previous day. As of the reporting time, the LINK price is trading at $14.05, with a 5% surge in the past 24-hours. The Chainlink price prediction shows potential to exceed $20, while the LINK price might achieve $30 before Trump delivers his crypto summit speech, provided bulls maintain their momentum. Final Thought To sum up, the growth outlook for USA coins to buy appears strong, including the present Trump summit political event. Market development requires continuous investor observation to determine upcoming industry actions. The post 4 USA Coins to Buy Ahead of Trump’s Crypto Summit Speech appeared first on CoinGape .

Article 91: Urgent Warning: ECB President Flags Tariffs’ Devastating Impact on Eurozone Inflation
Content:
Are you prepared for a potential jolt to the global economy? ECB President Christine Lagarde has just dropped a bombshell, and it could directly impact your finances and the broader market sentiment. In a recent address, she highlighted a significant threat looming over the Eurozone: Eurozone inflation could surge by a staggering 0.5 percentage points if tariffs escalate between the U.S. and Europe. Let’s dive deep into what this means for you and the future of the European economy. Why ECB President Lagarde’s Warning on Tariffs Matters Christine Lagarde, the head of the European Central Bank (ECB), isn’t known for mincing words, especially when it comes to economic stability. Her recent statement on March 20th regarding the potential tariffs impact is a clear signal of concern. According to the ECB’s analysis, a 25% tariff imposed by the U.S. on European imports could immediately clip 0.3 percentage points off the Eurozone’s economic growth in the first year alone. But the story doesn’t end there. Lagarde elaborated on a potentially more alarming scenario: Initial Impact: A unilateral 25% U.S. tariff could reduce Eurozone GDP growth by 0.3 pp. Retaliatory Measures: If Europe responds by increasing tariffs on U.S. goods, the economic downturn could deepen to 0.5 pp. Inflationary Pressure: Counter-tariffs from the EU, coupled with a possible weakening of the euro, could ignite Eurozone inflation , pushing it upwards by approximately 0.5 pp. This isn’t just abstract economic theory; these are real-world implications that could affect businesses, consumers, and investors across Europe and beyond. Decoding the Economic Fallout: Growth and Inflation Dynamics To truly grasp the gravity of Lagarde’s warning, let’s break down the intertwined challenges of economic growth Eurozone and inflation in the context of tariffs. The Growth Conundrum Tariffs act as a tax on international trade. When the U.S. imposes tariffs on European goods, it makes these goods more expensive for American consumers and businesses. This can lead to: Reduced Exports: European businesses may find it harder to sell their products in the U.S. market due to increased prices, leading to decreased export volumes. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt established supply chains, forcing businesses to find alternative, potentially more expensive, sources for inputs. Investment Uncertainty: The threat of tariffs creates uncertainty, discouraging businesses from investing in expansion or new projects, fearing future trade barriers. These factors collectively contribute to a slowdown in economic growth Eurozone . The initial 0.3 pp reduction is a significant hit, and a further drop to 0.5 pp with retaliatory tariffs paints a concerning picture of economic stagnation. The Inflation Inferno While slower growth is a serious concern, the potential surge in Eurozone inflation is equally, if not more, alarming. Here’s how tariffs can fuel inflation: Direct Price Increases: Tariffs directly increase the cost of imported goods. These higher costs can be passed on to consumers, leading to price hikes across various sectors. Retaliatory Tariffs: When Europe retaliates with its own tariffs on U.S. goods, it makes American products more expensive in Europe. This, too, contributes to inflationary pressures within the Eurozone. Currency Depreciation: Lagarde mentioned a ‘declining euro’ as a contributing factor to inflation. Trade tensions and economic uncertainty can weaken the euro’s value. A weaker euro makes imports more expensive (as you need more euros to buy the same amount of foreign currency), further driving up inflation. An inflation spike of 0.5 pp might seem modest, but in an environment where central banks are battling to control rising prices, any additional inflationary pressure is unwelcome. It could force the ECB to maintain or even increase interest rates, further dampening economic growth Eurozone and potentially triggering a vicious cycle. Europe vs. US Trade Tensions: A Deep Dive The current trade tensions between Europe US trade partners are not happening in a vacuum. They are part of a broader global shift towards protectionism and economic nationalism. Understanding the context is crucial. Historical Perspective Trade relations between the U.S. and Europe have historically been complex, marked by both cooperation and disputes. While both regions are major economic powerhouses and allies, disagreements over trade practices, agricultural subsidies, and regulatory standards have surfaced periodically. Current Flashpoints The potential 25% tariff mentioned by ECB President Lagarde is likely related to ongoing disputes in sectors like: Automobiles: The U.S. has previously threatened tariffs on European cars, citing national security concerns. Agriculture: Disagreements over agricultural subsidies and market access have been a long-standing issue. Digital Services: Europe’s moves to tax digital services provided by large U.S. tech companies have also strained relations. The Geopolitical Dimension Beyond purely economic considerations, Europe US trade relations are also intertwined with geopolitical dynamics. A trade war could weaken transatlantic ties at a time when global cooperation is needed to address various challenges, from climate change to geopolitical instability. Navigating the Tariffs Storm: Actionable Insights For businesses and individuals within the Eurozone, understanding the potential tariffs impact and the resulting Eurozone inflation is crucial for making informed decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Businesses: Diversify Markets: Reduce reliance on the U.S. market by exploring alternative export destinations in Asia, Latin America, or within the EU single market. Supply Chain Resilience: Assess and diversify supply chains to minimize disruption from potential tariffs. Consider sourcing inputs from regions less likely to be affected by trade tensions. Scenario Planning: Develop contingency plans for different tariff scenarios. Model the potential impact of tariffs on costs, revenues, and profitability. Individuals: Budgeting for Inflation: Be prepared for potentially higher prices due to Eurozone inflation . Review your household budget and identify areas where you can cut back if necessary. Investment Strategy: Consider the potential impact of trade tensions and inflation on your investment portfolio. Diversification across asset classes and geographies can help mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in Europe US trade relations and ECB policy announcements. Reliable news sources and financial analysis can help you stay ahead of the curve. Conclusion: A Call for Prudence and Cooperation ECB President Lagarde’s stark warning about the tariffs impact on Eurozone inflation and economic growth Eurozone is a wake-up call. Escalating trade tensions between Europe US trade partners pose a significant threat to economic stability on both sides of the Atlantic. While tariffs might be intended to protect domestic industries, the broader economic consequences, including heightened inflation and reduced growth, can be far-reaching and damaging. The path forward requires prudence, dialogue, and a commitment to international cooperation. Avoiding a trade war is not just about economics; it’s about preserving global stability and fostering a more prosperous future for all. Let’s hope that cooler heads prevail and that policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic recognize the urgent need for de-escalation and constructive engagement.

Article 92: Can DTX Exchange Win Against Solana After Listing Announcement? Expert Sets Target at $10
Content:
The post Can DTX Exchange Win Against Solana After Listing Announcement? Expert Sets Target at $10 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News DTX Exchange has emerged as a disruptive force in the bull market, with analysts and investors in awe of its presale mania. Experts claim that the hybrid platform can win against Solana (SOL) after its listing. The DTX tokens give SOL-like features at a much lower investment cost in the current session. Its ROI potential is also similar to that of SOL, thus it is expected to touch the $10 target after its listing. Solana price is tumbling in the current session with a massive red candle ruling the Solana price charts. Experts suggest this price slump could force investors to flock to DTX Exchange as the hybrid token has become a key to massive gains in the current session. DTX Exchange’s 4x CEX Listing: A Potential Game-Changer While Solana price struggles, DTX Exchange (DTX) positioned itself as the future of hybrid trading. Unlike traditional crypto exchanges, DTX provides access to over 120,000 assets, including stocks, ETFs, forex, and digital currencies, all on a Layer-1 blockchain. The platform’s hybrid model allows both institutional and retail traders to operate seamlessly without KYC restrictions, offering transparency and enterprise-grade analytics for smarter decision-making. One of DTX’s biggest advantages is its presale structure, which offers early buyers a unique chance to double their investment before the token even hits exchanges. Currently, the token is priced at $0.18, but upon listing, this is expected to rise to $0.36, a built-in 2x listing increase, and for early investors this 2x could be 4x by using the “LIST2X” promo code. With additional momentum, DTX could see exponential gains in the short term, far outpacing SOL price movements. The hybrid platform has been fully audited by SolidProof, ensuring a safe and transparent trading environment. Furthermore, DTX Exchange reaches transaction processing speeds of 200,000 transactions per second through its VulcanX blockchain framework, which positions it ahead of the competition, notably Solana, in this session. The platform also offers 1000x leverage, allowing traders to capitalize on their investments. Solana Price Path To $178: Technical Indicators Of SOL Solana’s price is currently slumping in this session while its short-term price analysis is still looking bullish. With increased investor confidence analysts are saying Solana price is heading to $178 in the short term. The technicals support this view. If Solana price breaks its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), the selling pressure will ease, and the SOL token can climb to its 50-day simple moving average (SMA). But there’s resistance at $178. If SOL breaks this resistance it can trigger more upside. If it falls below $120 it can correct down to $110 or $90. Thus a break through $140 can ignite a bullish momentum toward $178. In the longer term, Solana’s price chart shows the potential for a cup-and-handle pattern, which, if confirmed, could drive the Solana price to as high as $3,800. This long-term target depends on the successful breakout of key resistance levels. SOL’s performance and the recently bridged assets are making investors wait with bated breath for more. The activity on the network including the recent 5th anniversary celebrations is adding to the positive vibes around the chain. Despite the setbacks like SIMD-0228 proposal failure, the quick decision-making in the SOL community is seen as a silver lining. With increased investor interest Solana is looking good for short-term gains but market watchers will be cautious and will be watching key levels and broader market conditions to see if this rally is sustainable. For long-term gains, DTX Exchange remains the best investment option. Key Takeaways The Solana price is struggling at a critical zone with SOL tokens at the verge of a massive slump or a rally simultaneously. In these circumstances, DTX Exchange emerges as the best investment option that could possibly defeat the Solana price actions after its listing. The platform’s high demand has made it a rising star in DeFi space. Learn more: Buy Presale Visit DTX Website Join The DTX Community

Article 94: Pakistan Expands Crypto Trading Offerings Amid US & Global Push, Here’s All
Content:
Pakistan is taking a bold step towards crypto legalization, aligning with the global trend of promoting digital assets. Focusing on international investments and economic growth, Pakistan is establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. The country is expanding its digital asset trading offerings, attracting global investors and reflecting the global crypto adoption. In a recent development, Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib revealed the country’s vision of solidifying its position at the forefront of the blockchain space. This development coincides with global powers, including the United States, striving to establish themselves as premier crypto hubs. Pakistan Legalizes Cryptocurrencies: What To Know According to recent reports, Pakistan is introducing a solid legal framework for cryptocurrencies, in an attempt to establish itself as a global leader in the blockchain space. With a vision of attracting international investors, Pakistan intends to expand its crypto trading offerings. Particularly, the country’s crypto initiative focuses on three key areas including Bitcoin mining, tokenization, and trading. Reflecting on the development, Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib shared an X post . Saqib unveiled Pakistan’s efforts to foster crypto growth and adoption, positioning itself as a crypto leader. The Crypto Council CEO stated, We want Pakistan as the leader in blockchain-powered finance, and we want to attract international investment. Sixty percent of the population is under 30 [years old], we have a Web3-native workforce ready to build. Pakistan Joins Crypto Big Leagues Notably, blockchain analytics platform Chainalysis identified Pakistan as the ninth largest country in terms of crypto adoption. As pointed out by Saqib, Pakistan continues to be a developing crypto hub with nearly 20 million community members. During the last market rally, Pakistan reportedly witnessed $30 billion in remittances and $20 billion in crypto transactions. Experts believe that the country could thrive even more with clear crypto regulations, considering its potential for growth without them. Further, the Crypto Council CEO stated that the country’s tech-savvy citizens and budding fintech professionals contribute to Pakistan’s vision. This makes Pakistan well-positioned to compete with crypto leaders like Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai. This comes amid anticipations of US President Donald Trump addressing Blockworks’ Digital Asset Summit (DAS) in New York City on March 20. His speech is expected to focus on BTC adoption among institutions, regulatory developments, and the future of the crypto industry. Global Push for Crypto Growth and Adoption Significantly, global powers, including the United States, are establishing a crypto-friendly environment, recognizing the potential of the industry. For instance, the US is adopting a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve under President Donald Trump. In addition, President Trump is envisioning a regulatory overhaul that guarantees both crypto expansion and customer protection. Moreover, countries like Russia, Brazil, and Poland are also discussing to establish a Bitcoin reserve. Recently, North Korea’s increasing Bitcoin accumulation sparked speculations of the country’s possible BTC reserve plans. Thus, Pakistan’s crypto legalization has sparked widespread interest as the country aims to lift its years-long crypto restrictions. The development highlights the nation’s shifting stance on digital assets and its desire to tap into the growing crypto market.

Article 96: Cathie Wood Issues Memecoin Warning, Says ‘Millions’ Will End Up Being ‘Worthless’
Content:
The founder and CEO of the investment management firm ARK Invest is warning the public of the risks of trading memecoins. In a new interview on Bloomberg Crypto, Cathie Wood says that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did an important thing in declaring that memecoins are not securities. “ What they essentially were saying is we are not going to regulate them and it’s buyer beware, so I have one message for those listening who are buying memecoins, buyer beware. I think the message is loud and clear from the regulators.” She says that many memecoins will eventually lose their value. “What we think will happen is there will be some fearsome declines in the prices of some of these meme assets and there’s nothing like losing money for people to learn. Now learn that the SEC and regulators are not taking responsibility for these memecoins.” Wood says that while the leading crypto assets are bound to become more valuable, this is not the case for the large majority of memecoins. “The millions of memecoins will probably end up worthless. When we’re talking about the big three – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, the use cases for those are multiplying and we think they’re going to become very important in the years ahead. Memecoins, not so.” Wood also shares her thoughts on whether President Donald Trump’s memecoin will also become worthless. “ Memecoins will be collector’s items – digital collector’s items. Of course, some will withstand the judgment of time and that may be one of them, but our working assumption is that when you’re talking about millions of memecoins, you know that that’s just a step too far and most of them are not going to be worth very much.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Article 100: Xandeum introduces pNodes, a storage scaling solution on Solana
Content:
Xandeum, a blockchain -focused software development company, has unveiled incentivized Provider Nodes (pNodes), a new storage scaling solution on Solana ( SOL ), as per the reports shared with Finbold on Thursday, March 20. Designed to address some critical bottleneck issues on Solana, pNodes offer scalable, efficient storage for smart contracts on the network. Xandeum pNodes pNodes integrate directly with the programs on Solana to create a decentralized storage layer for data-heavy Web3 applications. As such, pNodes address Solana’s lack of a native, scalable storage mechanism by allowing smart contracts to access a distributed storage network. This unlocks new possibilities for blockchain developers , crypto traders, and potential investors looking to capitalize on the growing Web3 sector while potentially earning rewards. Developers of storage-intensive decentralized applications (dApps) will benefit the most, although crypto investors, adopters, and node operators looking to make some passive income can also look forward to new investment opportunities. Secure data storage Xandeum leverages erasure coding and configurable redundancy levels to ensure secure data storage across multiple pNodes. This ensures reliability and decentralization while giving Solana validators some room to breathe, as they traditionally have to store data and ensures blockchain-grade integrity. To accomplish their goals, Xandeum’s Validator Nodes manage and distribute storage tasks cryptographically, which helps retain data integrity intact without sacrificing speed. In addition, new Solana primitives (“peek” and “poke”) facilitate data transfers between Solana accounts and its decentralized file system abstraction. Xandeum’s “Deep South Era” Xandeum’s pNodes will mark the start of the platform’s Deep South Era, that is, the first innovation phase in 2025. The phase will also introduce XandMiner, a new management tool for registering pNodes, generating key pairs, and building (or destroying) file systems. A limited sale of 300 incentivized devnet pNodes will be introduced to mark the launch (max 3 per wallet). The mainnet version will be fully permissionless and open access to all participants.

Article 102: Lazarus Group sends $3.76m worth of Bitcoin to five unknown address
Content:
North Korean hacker group, Lazarus Group, was seen sending Bitcoin to multiple unknown addresses, bringing their total holdings down to 13,441 BTC, according to on-chain data. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, the North Korean hacker group’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings are now worth around $1.15 billion after the mass transfers. On March 20 at around 9:18 AM UTC, the wallet sent 12.929 BTC or equal to $1.12 million to an unknown wallet address. Following the 12.929 BTC transfer, the wallet continued to send Bitcoin to four other wallet addresses. Two unknown wallets each received 0.308 BTC, one wallet received around 14.849 BTC, another received 15.684 BTC. In total, the wallet sent out more than 44.07 BTC ($3.76 million) to five different wallet addresses in the past three hours. The fact that the Lazarus Group is distributing its BTC holdings across multiple wallets , the group may be doing so for laundering purposes to make the funds even more difficult to trace back. Earlier today, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou claimed that 88.87% of the stolen funds from the exchange is still traceable through on-chain data. According to Zhou, around 86.29% of the stolen funds — or equal to $1.23 billion — has been converted into 12,836 Bitcoin and spread across as many as 9,117 wallets. Zhou believes the hackers have been using Bitcoin mixers to scramble the transaction history, making the stolen funds even harder to track.

The Lazarus Group is a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, has been active since at least 2009. Their earliest known operation was called “Operation Troy,” which targeted the South Korean government. The group’s latest heist was a hack on the Bybit crypto exchange, which led to the platform losing around $1.4 billion. The hack is considered one of the largest crypto hacks ever recorded.

Article 103: Ripple: Free At Last, Will XRP Adoption Finally Take Off?
Content:
Summary XRP's regulatory clarity following the SEC case boosts its potential for institutional adoption and spot ETF approval, making it a compelling buy despite past reservations. Ripple CEO's announcement of the SEC case resolution led to a 12% XRP price jump, with further gains expected upon official SEC confirmation. The current market volatility and geopolitical tensions suggest a long-term holding strategy for XRP, as momentum trading is riskier now. The approval of XRP spot ETFs could dilute inflows for BTC and ETFs, but aligns with the increasing institutional interest and regulatory support for crypto assets. It's been exactly three months since I last wrote on Ripple ( XRP-USD ) here on Seeking Alpha. My last coverage heavily leaned on the RLUSD stablecoin and the opportunities it presents for the Ripple ecosystem, and the on-chain liquidity and use case it potentially creates for the XRP Ledger. In that piece, I hinted at XRP not being one of my favorite cryptos to hold in the current crypto market cycle. Here’s my reason in the excerpt from that article below: XRP isn't one of my favorite altcoins at the moment because I think it won't be among the most rewarding crypto assets in this bull season of the market cycle. XRP has had impressive runs in the last two bull markets, especially during the 2017 crypto bull market. However, in the spirit of the current crypto bull market, I'm upgrading my rating for XRP to a “buy” despite my reservations about XRP giving impressive gains moving forward. Excerpt from previous XRP coverage Prior to that article, XRP had rallied for months after a federal judge gave Ripple a slap-on-the-wrist fine of $125 million (compared to the over $2 billion fine the SEC was pushing for), with an injunction order against securities laws violation in the future. The SEC had tried to appeal the ruling. Additionally, President Trump’s pre- and post-election “Trump effect” on the crypto market was still in full swing at that time. And following that article, XRP (as well as much of the crypto market) rallied further, until halted by the steep market correction we’ve seen recently due to geopolitics - mainly tariff wars - which has also affected the broader equity market. XRP has built a die-hard following over the years that the power of its community has enabled XRP to become one of the cryptocurrencies that's hard to ignore. XRP makes the news one way or the other. Over the years, the SEC’s years-long case with XRP garnered much attention that the SEC vs XRP case was thought of as the litmus test for how crypto issuers launch and distribute crypto tokens. Today, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced on X that the SEC vs Ripple four-year-long legal brawl was finally over. Brad’s announcement is technically unofficial as the SEC is yet to make an official declaration, and according to Brad, the SEC would drop its appeal on the ruling made by the federal judge in August last year. XRP price action following Brad Garlinghouse's announcement (Seeking Alpha) The “unofficial” announcement from the CEO saw XRP jump ~12% from the daily open price of $2.28, to reach a daily high of $2.59. XRP closed March 19 at $2.55. I think in the coming weeks, when the SEC formalizes its decision, and the SEC makes the official announcement, XRP price could gain further on the news if momentum returns to crypto in general. The SEC case with Ripple was not a nothingburger for Ripple, and it has limited XRP adoption over the years. Though Ripple Labs focuses on building tech that is institution-grade out of the box, XRP was largely shunned by institutions due to the risk of enforcement actions. Now that the case is coming to a close and the regulatory classification of XRP is clearly defined, XRP and Ripple products are bound to see broader adoption, especially by institutions. An XRP ETF, Anyone? Crypto spot ETFs are becoming mainstream and a slew of approval for major crypto assets are likely to happen in the future, with the current U.S. government friendly stance toward crypto. I'm viewing the spot ETFs like the early days of crypto tokens after ICO launches on Ethereum made them possible. The early crypto tokens had the advantage of garnering enough liquidity. Launching of crypto tokens is effortless these days, and hundreds (if not thousands) of tokens (mostly meme coins) are launched daily; therefore, there is thinner liquidity spread among altcoins. We’ve seen how the “alt season” has been delayed in this market cycle, and utility tokens have had to grapple with fragmented liquidity. I foresee a similar trend with crypto spot ETFs. For now, only Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) spot ETFs have been approved in the U.S., and they enjoy all the demand and inflows into spot ETFs. In the event that the floodgates to approvals open a bit more, and more spot ETFs see approval, there will likely be diluted liquidity distribution among these ETFs, which will impact their demand ratio, in my view. Spot ETF proposals have already been filed for Solana ( SOL-USD ), Cardano ( ADA-USD ), Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ), as well as XRP. Following today's announcement, Brad stated emphatically in a Bloomberg interview that XRP will be added to the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, and he is confident that XRP spot ETFs will come before the year ends. As for XRP’s inclusion in the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, that's out of the scope of my investment thesis. The likelihood of seeing XRP spot ETFs this year aligns with my analysis, and I lean towards agreeing with him. XRP’s regulatory definition is coming at a timely moment when it is likely that the XRP spot ETF will be the next to see approval. Ripple CEO has been one of the crypto execs lobbying the White House for clearer policies that will favor the industry since President Trump assumed office. He was present at the first-ever White House Crypto Summit, and it is rumored that among the crypto execs lobbying the White House, Brad is one of the favorite candidates to likely be on the White House Crypto Advisory Council . The CEO’s engagements with the White House brings Ripple a step closer to having a main seat at the policymaking table. This bodes well for Ripple Labs as a company and is bullish for XRP. Risks and Takeaway The last weeks have been highly volatile for crypto assets. President Trump's positive stance towards crypto has been overshadowed by his own macro policies, particularly the tariffs. Technical charts are uncertain at the moment, and the uncertainty and doubt is heightened throughout the market. XRP’s new regulatory clarity is the type of news that should typically create sustained momentum for the crypto asset; however, in the current FUD-filled clime of the market, gains have been short-lived. I think it’s best to have a longer-term view if you plan to hold crypto assets, including XRP. Momentum trading is currently riskier. Regulatory clarity for XRP means potential spot XRP ETFs approval, and it opens doors to more institutional partnerships for Ripple. If the crypto market still has momentum left in this cycle, I expect XRP to deliver at least modest returns from here, now that the shackles are finally off.

Article 105: Crypto companies strive to obtain banking licenses. Exploring the growing intersection of banks and crypto platforms
Content:
On Mar. 18, 2025, Reuters reported that various crypto companies seek to become state or national banks, which they see as an avenue for expanding their businesses under the Trump Administration. What can change for crypto companies once they become banks? Don’t they already serve as banks? Aren’t banks increasingly embracing crypto? Multi-faceted crypto platforms and banks have had overlapping functionality as many people can store their savings via crypto, grow capital using yield mining or staking, or get crypto loans. In regions with a high unbanked population that has smartphones, crypto platforms already occupy a bank-like position. However, getting licensed as a state or national bank is different from just being a defacto bank-like entity. Let’s see what the prospects are for the crypto platforms seeking to become full-fledged banks. As the U.S. took a pro-crypto course, these companies have a bigger chance of transforming into banks. The modern-day regulators don’t see crypto as something utterly inadmissible. Reuters cites lawyers admitting that there is a rising interest from crypto companies that are cautiously seeking new opportunities. Read more: Trump-era policy shift sparks crypto firms’ push for banking licenses: report SmartBiz acquired Centrust Bank, becoming the first fintech company to get a bank charter since 2021, indicating a possible trend setting. Earlier this month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reversed the banks’ anti-crypto stance, permitting banks to engage in cryptocurrency-related activity, including stablecoins operations, crypto custody, etc. Why do some crypto platforms want to transform into banks? First off, the companies hope to obtain bank status to boost their credibility. It may attract new individual and corporate clients, as banks seem more trustworthy and familiar to them than cryptocurrency ecosystems. It opens new opportunities and allows companies to scale up substantially. Bank charter is associated with additional scrutiny, but on the other hand, it gives companies a more legitimate image that is important for business expansion. The second reason is that bank regulations pull crypto out of the grey zone, giving the companies a clearer legislative environment, thus providing a more predictable development trajectory and the opportunity to follow their strategies more confidently. Another benefit of getting a bank charter is direct access to clients’ deposits. Without it, crypto companies have to borrow funds and pay high fees. With clients’ deposits, companies may be less constrained in their actions and development. An intersection of banks and crypto platforms Although blockchain has literally been antagonistic towards banks from day one (remember the message attached to the genesis block of Bitcoin), both banks and cryptocurrency businesses managed to co-exist and shape each other’s ways of operation. It seems that crypto no longer poses an existential threat to banks. Banks were adopting blockchain solutions, while crypto platforms adopted many of banks’ services, like loans and more basic operations like remittance. Traditional banks use blockchain solutions for various reasons. Distributed ledger and smart contracts infrastructure allow banks to automate some processes and reduce costs, elevate compliance and overall security of funds and data, and increase settlement speed, especially when it comes to cross-border transactions. It’s worth saying that not only does automation make the services cheaper, but it also eliminates human errors and prevents fraudulent activity. Such companies as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs use blockchain to streamline the Know Your Customer verification process. An international consortium of banks, Fnality International (it includes Barclays plc, HSBC Holdings, and other major banks), uses blockchain for cross-border transactions. These are only a few examples of many. CBDCs will reduce the intermediary engagement between citizens and central banks while not stopping commercial banks from providing services like crediting and others. At the same time, cryptocurrency platforms were serving as banks in the rural unbanked areas with high mobile Internet penetration. Such areas can be found in Sub-Saharan Africa and some of the Asian regions. The residents of these areas mostly use crypto for remittance and savings. The early 2020s saw the rise of neobanks, digital-first online banks that offer traditional banking services. The customer-centric approach and use of peer-to-peer solutions gave neobanks advantages over traditional banks. They charge lower fees, provide user-friendly apps, and usually have a more favorable approach to providing credits/loans to clients. Most popular digital banks like Chime or Revolut account for tens of millions of clients. According to Plaid, over 21% of people aged between 21 and 56 were using neobanks as their primary checking account. The adoption of cryptocurrencies was a logical step in the development of some of the neobanks. Revolut is a notable example of a neobank supporting cryptocurrency operations on top of other features like stock trading, currency exchange, and virtual cards. We will likely see more crypto companies becoming banks in the future, as both the U.S. regulators and businesses express interest in such a development. Soon, we will learn if other countries are taking notes. You might also like: Neobanks are bridging financial gaps with blockchain | Opinion

XRP price has recorded a surge of over 6% today, hovering around the $2.5 mark amid a broader crypto market recovery. Amid this, a renowned market expert has predicted a potential rally to $38 for Ripple’s native asset, citing technical and historical trends. Besides, the recent Ripple Vs SEC update has further fueled speculations in the market. XRP Price Surged 6%: A New ATH Imminent? XRP price has surged more than 6% today and traded at $2.48, while its one-day trading volume skyrocketed 233% to $10.5 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high and low of $2.57 and $2.31. Besides, the XRP Futures Open Interest rose more than 15% to $3.76 billion, reflecting the soaring market interest. Amid this, a flurry of investors has indicated a potential rally for Ripple’s native asset’s price. With Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealing a potential big win in the XRP lawsuit, the community has been eying the future trajectory of the coin. XRP Price To Hit $38? In a recent X post, expert Gert van Lagen made a bold prediction for XRP price, forecasting a parabolic continuation of its bull market. According to van Lagen’s analysis, Ripple’s native asset is poised to bounce off the neckline of a 7-year-old Double Bottom/Ascending Triangle pattern. According to his analysis, XRP is targeting a minimum of $38 based on historical trends. The last breakout of lesser magnitude resulted in the price doubling its parabolic target, indicating a potentially conservative estimate. Notably, Van Lagen’s analysis suggests a high level of confidence in XRP’s bullish trajectory. The implications of van Lagen’s prediction are significant, indicating a potential major upside move for Ripple’s native asset. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, expert analysis like van Lagen’s provides valuable insights for investors and enthusiasts alike. Source: Gert van Lagen, X What Lies Ahead? A flurry of trends indicates a potential rally for the coin ahead. Besides, the recent comments from Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty regarding the cross-appeal have further boosted the sentiment. On the other hand, the recent XRP investment advancements have sparked hopes for a robust rally ahead. For context, Bitnomial launched the XRP Futures Contract recently, which has gained notable traction from traders. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X On the other hand, EGRAG CRYPTO has recently predicted XRP price to hit $27 in the near term. In addition, in a separate analysis, he said that the crypto is poised to hit $8 in the near term once it closes above the $2.9 support.

Article 108: Majority of EU crypto payments spent on retail, food, and beverages: Report
Content:
Retail transactions, food, and drinks make up most cryptocurrency usage behaviors in the European Union, a new mini-report by Oobit indicates. The study conducted an investigation of six months of Oobit usage data. The statistics show that 70% of all crypto costs are categorized as day-to-day retail purchases. Romania, Poland, and Hungary were also the top three nations for crypto payment usage on the Oobit platform. USDT is the leading choice of payment currency Tether’s USDT has become the go-to stablecoin for European crypto payments. USDT made up 92% of all transactions that were made via the Oobit app. The transaction records reveal fascinating trends in the manner in which people use the platform. The overall average payment amount for all the nations covered in the report was quite small at $8.36. This indicates that users are mostly making use of crypto for small, routine purchases as opposed to significant expenses. As opposed to that, the average deposit amount was much larger at $85. This implies that users tend to top up their accounts with significant amounts that get spent over numerous small transactions. Outside of retail, food, and drinks (which comprised 70% of expenditure), the second-biggest category for crypto transactions comprised 26% of expenses. It consists of accommodation, travel, and aviation services. Government services and digital payments comprise only 1.5% of expenditure, with another 1.5% comprising miscellaneous services such as healthcare and entertainment. The top five countries in crypto payment adoption via Oobit were Lithuania, Spain, Hungary, Poland, and Romania. Although average payment sizes were fairly uniform among these markets (from $7.1 in Romania to $9.3 in Spain), deposit sizes varied more. The standout was Lithuania, with an average deposit of $169. That is considerably higher than Romania’s $37 average. Country-specific trends reveal regulatory impact The top three nations for crypto payment adoption via Oobit were Romania, Poland, and Hungary. All three have one thing in common: they are building crypto-friendly regulatory environments. This indicates that government policy is a driving force behind consumer adoption of digital asset payments. Romania had the highest number of active users, although it had the lowest average payment size at $7.1 and the lowest average deposit at $37. The nation’s new tax policy could be the reason for this increase. Romania recently implemented a tax break amendment to its fiscal code that excludes income from crypto investments by natural persons until July 31, 2025. As per the report, the move is meant to “improve transparency in crypto transactions as well as allow for the mapping of this new market into the Romanian economy.” Similar to other leading markets, Romanian consumers mostly spent on food, retail, and beverages, with 71% of the transactions in this category. Poland was in second place when it comes to usage statistics for Oobit, with average payment sizes of $8.3 and average deposits of $49. The report also mentions that crypto has entered mainstream political debate in Poland. Poland has already had a regulatory framework set in place that permits crypto firms like exchanges to operate legally, laying the groundwork for consumer adoption. Hungary trailed closely with an average payment amount of $7.9 and average deposits of $41. The nation has made tangible strides toward end-to-end crypto regulation. Its Ministry for National Economy introduced a draft law that would enable domestic banks to provide digital assets directly to customers under the oversight of the Hungarian National Bank. Hungary’s parliament also passed Act VII of 2024 on Markets in Crypto-Assets , which took effect in June 2024. Lithuania stands out for high-value engagement Lithuania is one of the top five crypto payment markets in Europe. The users in this region have also shown higher deposit values despite similar transaction patterns. With an average deposit of $169, Lithuanian users appear to fund their crypto payment accounts more substantially while maintaining average transaction sizes comparable to other markets at $8.1. The report attributes this outlier status to Lithuania’s position as “an established crypto business hub with low corporate taxes and a clear regulatory framework.” Lithuanian users showed the strongest concentration in retail spending among all top markets. This represents a notably higher percentage than the overall average of 70% across all markets. This suggests Lithuanian crypto payment adopters may be more focused on using digital assets specifically for daily shopping needs. Spain, ranking fourth in usage, recorded the highest average payment size at $9.3 with deposits averaging $77. However, Spanish users showed the most diverse spending pattern among the top five countries. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025. Learn More
Article 109: Spot crypto scams early: California’s new tracker tool, explained
Content:
What is California’s crypto scam tracker tool? On Feb. 16, 2023, the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) in California launched the crypto scam tracker tool to help residents spot and avoid crypto scams. The tracker details crypto scams identified through a review of complaints submitted by the public. California’s DFPI crypto scam tracker is a searchable database that compiles complaints about fraudulent schemes. Investors can use the database to identify and avoid crypto scams. You can search the database using company name, scam type or keywords. The tracker includes a glossary to explain commonly used crypto terms and is regularly updated with new scam reports. The glossary may not provide extensive information on prevalent crypto scams , but it equips you with the knowledge required to identify scams and protect yourself. The scam tracker tool has compiled the information from public complaints and has not independently verified reported losses. As the DFPI receives complaints about new crypto scams , it updates the information on the tracker to keep the investors informed. Anyone who has fallen victim to a crypto scam or fraud or becomes aware of a scam not yet listed on the scam tracker can inform the DFPI. You can submit a complaint online at dfpi.ca.gov/file-a-complaint or contact the department via toll-free phone at (866) 275-2677. Companies that have been mistakenly included in the tracker can contact the DFPI at ask.dfpi@dfpi.ca.gov for assistance. Did you know? In 2024, the DFPI received more than 2,668 complaints from investors in California and across the US. Based on these complaints, in partnership with the California Department of Justice, it shut down more than 26 different crypto scam websites and unraveled $4.6 million in consumer losses. How to use California’s crypto scam tracker tool California’s scam tracker tool is invaluable for identifying patterns in scammer behavior and helping investors avoid similar scams. Additionally, it encourages investors to report scams, contributing to the safety of the community. The tracker can be broadly used in three ways: For due diligence: You can search for specific companies or websites using the tool to uncover existing complaints. This feature helps you gain insights into others’ experiences with similar offers, allowing for a preliminary risk assessment. However, it’s important to note that the absence of complaints doesn’t guarantee legitimacy, as scam sites often rebrand or operate under different names. For analysis of messaging: The scam tracker enables you to analyze suspicious messaging by searching relevant keywords. You could use terms like “lending” or “insurance” to discover patterns and similarities between the offers you have received and past complaints. This comparative approach helps you identify potential red flags and recognize the tactics of the scamsters. For education and prevention: The tracker’s glossary serves as an educational resource, outlining various terms used in crypto scams. By familiarizing yourself with these tactics, you can significantly enhance your awareness and protect yourself from falling victim to fraudulent schemes. This proactive approach to education is essential in navigating the complex and often risky cryptocurrency market. Did you know? The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) 2023 Cryptocurrency Fraud Report shows California faced the highest crypto-related losses in the US, reaching $1.15 billion. Within the FBI San Francisco Field Office’s jurisdiction, losses totaled $260,313,902, affecting 1,226 victims across 15 counties, including Alameda, San Francisco and Santa Clara. How does California’s scam crypto tracker tool work? The tracker compiles scams reported directly by consumers. The entries detail descriptions of losses to the complainants. To view the information shared with the DFPI, you may use the search function to explore complaints by company, scam type or keywords. For instance, if you search using the keyword “trading platforms,” the tracker lists scams associated with the keyword. The tracker is segregated into five columns, comprising primary subject, complaint narrative, scam type, website and screenshot. To change the order of the list, you can click the arrow beside the column header. You can also determine the number of entries you want to see at the time. To select the number of entries on a page, click the dropdown box at the bottom of the list and select your chosen number. To toggle between the pages displaying the entries, you can use the buttons “Previous” and “Next.” Fraudulent schemes listed by California’s crypto scam tracker tool The crypto scam tracker exposes many fraudulent schemes plaguing the crypto space. From fake job offers to pig butchering scams , the tracker sheds light on the tactics used to deceive investors. Here are some examples of scams listed in the glossary section of the tracker tool. Pig butchering scam: A pig butchering scam involves fraudsters building trust with you through social, romantic or business interactions before luring you into a fake investment scheme and persuading you to transfer funds to a fraudulent platform. These platforms might even display fake profits to encourage further deposits. Victims are denied withdrawal of funds on various pretexts, and scammers eventually disappear with the money. Rug pull scams: These schemes involve developers who intentionally attract investors with false promises of high returns only to disappear with the money later. They often create a buzz on social media by roping in celebrities, which shoots up the cost of the tokens . Then the developers sell off their tokens to make big profits and crash the price, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Did you know? A single X post by Argentine President Javier Milei, promoting the LIBRA token , caused its market capitalization to surge to $4 billion. However, the subsequent deletion of the post within hours led to a rapid crash, resulting in substantial losses for investors. Crypto job scams: Fraudsters pose as recruiters, luring victims with fabricated job offers to steal cryptocurrency and sensitive data. These positions usually offer easy money in return for “jobs” that don’t require any specific expertise. For instance, the fraudster may be offering 100 US dollars for watching an hour of advertisements. These scams are designed to trick individuals into depositing crypto with fraudsters and getting access to critical information such as passwords to their wallets . Wallet drainer scams: Crypto drainers are designed to steal your digital assets by transferring them to a scammer’s wallet. These schemes tend to use social engineering, where fraudsters build trust with you through deceptive emails, calls and fabricated documents. They create fake crypto websites, enticing you with promises of airdrops or non-fungible token (NFT) minting . You end up approving transactions, believing you are signing legitimate contracts or claiming rewards, only to have your wallet emptied. Fraudulent trading platform: The scammer creates a deceptive website or application, persuading victims to deposit funds by presenting it as an exclusive investment opportunity. These fraudulent platforms are designed to look authentic, often mimicking actual price movements and generating fake profits to appear legitimate. Imposter scams: Imposter scams involve fraudsters posing as trusted figures, such as company executives, support staff or government officials, to deceive victims into sending funds or sharing sensitive information. These scammers often use fake websites, social media accounts or phishing emails to appear credible. Bitcoin mining scams: Bitcoin mining scams lure investors with fake opportunities to fund mining operations. Scammers claim invested capital will build the necessary infrastructure, like GPUs and servers, promising a share of the mined Bitcoin ( BTC ) as returns. But these investments are fraudulent, and the promised infrastructure rarely, if ever, exists. Steps taken by other US agencies and states to raise crypto scam awareness Protecting crypto investors from these fraudulent practices requires a robust and multifaceted approach. US federal and state regulators are collaborating to educate investors about emerging scam patterns and compile a comprehensive defense against fraudsters. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) protects consumers from scams. Users can report fraudulent activities on the FTC website and also find information on different types of scams. The FTC also manages the National Do Not Call Registry, which helps consumers block unwanted calls. Another key agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), plays an active role in regulating crypto assets. It issues fraud warnings, investigates companies, and reviews consumer complaints. Several US states have also taken initiatives to combat scams: New York: The New York Attorney General’s Office runs the Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau, which investigates scams and offers tips to help consumers stay safe. Massachusetts: The Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office uses advanced tools like the TRM Labs blockchain intelligence platform to trace stolen funds and fight crypto-related scams. Texas: The Texas Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division assists scam victims and guides them to avoid fraud. Florida: The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services maintains a Consumer Protection webpage with scam prevention tips and a complaint submission option. The US follows a multi-layered approach to crypto scam prevention and consumer protection. Federal agencies like the FTC and CFPB provide nationwide oversight and resources regarding the crypto space, while state-level initiatives offer localized support and specialized tools. This collaborative effort, combining education with enforcement, underscores the importance of vigilance and proactive measures in dealing with the complex landscape of scams. However, due to the fragmented crypto crime reporting system in the US, industry leaders advocate for a unified platform that consolidates data and allows victims to track complaints. While still in development, understanding this need helps set realistic expectations and supports ongoing reform efforts. As more stakeholders push for standardized measures, such a platform could significantly improve transparency, support victims, and foster stronger accountability within the crypto space.

Article 114: Arizona Leads Bitcoin Reserve Race As Two Bills Pass House Commerce Committee Vote
Content:
Arizona has taken the lead in the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) race after two bills passed the House of Representatives Commerce Committee vote on March 18. The state now has two active crypto reserve legislations and a legal tender bill, which have also advanced to the next stage. House Commerce Committee Passes Bitcoin Reserve Bills On Tuesday, the Arizona House Commerce Committee met to consider three Bitcoin-related legislations, including two strategic reserve bills, which passed the vote to advance to the next legislative stage. Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025), also known as the “Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act,” passed the vote with a 6 – 4 majority. Bitcoin Laws noted that the vote “was along partisan lines: Republicans for; Democrats against.” If passed, the legislation, sponsored by Republican Senator Wendy Rogers, would allow public funds in Arizona, such as the state treasurer or state retirement system, to invest up to 10% of their assets under management in cryptocurrencies, focusing on Bitcoin (BTC). “If the United States Secretary of the Treasury establishes a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the storage of government Bitcoin holdings, a public fund may store the virtual currency holdings of the public fund in a secure segregated account within the strategic Bitcoin reserve,” SB1025 reads. The bill also provides a framework for public funds to diversify their investments and establishes clear guidelines and definitions to manage them. Meanwhile, Senate Bill 1373 (SB1373), sponsored by Republican Senator Mark Finchem, passed with a 6 – 4 vote on Tuesday. The legislation aims to establish a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund in the state, comprised of seized cryptocurrencies and appropriated legislative funds that can be held through secure custody solutions or exchange-traded products (ETPs). The fund would be managed by the state treasurer, who could invest up to 10% of its total deposit in any fiscal year and may loan its assets to generate additional returns if it doesn’t increase the state’s financial risks. “The bill also outlines strict requirements for secure custody solutions, including exclusive key access, encrypted environments, hardware maintenance in multiple secure data centers, multi-party governance, comprehensive logging, regular security audits, and disaster recovery protocols,” Bitcoin Laws explains. Arizona Takes The SBR Lead After Utah scrapped its BTC reserve clause, Arizona became the state with the most advanced SBR legislation. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Utah State Senate exited the SBR race this month after amending the proposed bill allowing the state treasury to invest in digital assets. Following this development, Arizona took the lead with two reserve bills awaiting a final floor vote in the Senate before moving to the House Commerce Committee. Both strategic reserve bills now move to the House Rules Committee, which has a 5 – 3 Republican majority. If they pass the Rules Committee vote, SB1015 and SB1373 will only require a vote by the full House before heading to the governor’s desk. Similarly, another BTC-related bill passed the House Commerce Committee on Tuesday with a 6-4 vote and heads to the next stage. Senate Bill 1062 (SB1062), also sponsored by Senator Mark Finchem, aims to expand the state’s definition of legal tender to include cryptocurrencies, including BTC, alongside traditional currencies. The legislation also updates different sections of Arizona’s tax code to include the new legal tender definition and ensure consistency across different statutes, suggesting an effort to recognize the industry as a key sector.

Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. However, with the ongoing volatility in the cryptocurrency market, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 55.67% from its ATH of $ 294.33.

This marks the lowest level since September 2024. Consistency in this could open the doors for more projects being built out of the Solana network. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400.

Article 116: How Binance Could Fuel Next Solana Price Rally to $300
Content:
Solana price could be on the verge of a bullish breakout after on-chain data revealed that exchange giant Binance has been gradually accumulating SOL over the past month. As buying pressure increases, can Solana rally past $300 to a fresh all-time high? Binance Could Fuel The Next Solana Price Rally Popular analyst MartyParty has opined that Binance will drive the next Solana price rally. In his analysis, he compared Solana’s 50% pullback in March and Binance’s accumulation trend, which shows the exchange has heavily bought the dip. Data from Arkham supports the analyst’s outlook. It reveals that Binance’s Solana holdings have surged by 37% within one month from 16M SOL to the current balance of 22M SOL. Binance’s Solana holdings are now at their highest level since November 2024. Binance Solana Holdings On-chain analytics platform Glassnode also revealed that the recent decline in Solana price drove accumulation. It noted that after the price fell to $123 last week, traders bought 16.2M SOL . They also purchased 19M SOL at $126. This accumulation could offer support for SOL price between $123 and $126, preventing a prolonged downtrend. If this level holds, it will support a bullish Solana price forecast past $300. Can Solana Reach $300? Solana price today trades at $131 with a slight 1.5% gain in 24 hours. The altcoin has formed an ascending triangle pattern on its daily chart according to analyst Nebraskangooner. If the ongoing accumulation trend by Binance and long-term holders continues, SOL could break out from the upper trendline, which is also the 20-day EMA. If SOL overcomes the strong resistance at $137, it could continue with the uptrend toward the 50-day EMA at $158. However, a strong move to $300 will be confirmed if Solana price flips the 200-day EMA. The MACD indicator is also showing signs of more Solana price gains . The histogram bars are green, indicating an increase in buying activity. However, the bullish momentum is weak because the MACD remains negative. A strong uptrend will happen if this line crosses above the zero line. SOL/USD: 1-day Chart Besides the bullish technical outlook, today’s launch of the first SOL Futures ETF by Volatility Shares could also spark a bull run. Additionally, network activity on the Solana blockchain is rising again. Data from DappRadar shows that in the last 24 hours, dApp volumes on the network surged by more than 300% from $78M to $190M. The total transactions have also risen to 19.3M, which is the highest in more than a week. Solana dApp Volumes High network activity has always been a bullish catalyst for Solana price. If this continues as traders buy the dip, SOL can attain the $300 price target soon. The post How Binance Could Fuel Next Solana Price Rally to $300 appeared first on CoinGape .
Article 117: Bitcoin Options Soar After FED Meeting! What's the Latest on Ethereum Options? Here Are the Details
Content:
Bitcoin (BTC) investors are increasingly betting on price gains via options markets following the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting, while Ethereum (ETH) continues to see cautious sentiment reflecting ongoing uncertainty despite the upcoming network upgrade. BTC Options Rise After Fed Meeting The shift in sentiment came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reaffirmed the central bank's forecast of two rate cuts this year and downplayed the inflationary impact of tariffs implemented under the Trump administration, calling them “temporary.” Data from Amberdata shows that Bitcoin’s risk returns have turned positive, meaning traders are now paying a premium for call options (bullish bets) over put options (bearish bets). This marks a significant reversal from previous weeks, when downside fears fueled demand for protective put options. According to Paradigm, an institutional over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform, options flows have seen an increase in demand for call options on March 21 and March 28, while put options were sold off, suggesting that investors are positioning for a potential BTC rally in the coming weeks. The shift in the options market coincides with broader optimism for regulatory clarity in the crypto industry following the conclusion of the SEC’s legal battle with Ripple, which could have positive implications. Ethereum Options Lag as Investors Remain Cautious Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum’s options market continues to reflect a bias toward downside protection and still commands a premium over calls, particularly for contracts expiring in May. Despite the upcoming Ethereum Pectra update that is expected to increase network efficiency and scalability, traders remain hesitant. The update, which will introduce smart accounts, blob scaling, and validator improvements, is set to go live on March 26, but Ethereum has yet to see any notable changes in sentiment. *This is not investment advice.

Article 120: Urgent Crypto Alert: Lazarus Group’s Massive Bitcoin Conversion Exposes $1.4B Theft
Content:
Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The digital underworld has been buzzing with a revelation that sounds straight out of a spy thriller. Bybit exchange CEO, Ben Zhou, dropped a bombshell on X, exposing the audacious tactics of the notorious North Korean Lazarus Group. These cyber masterminds, linked to a staggering $1.4 billion cryptocurrency heist, have reportedly converted a whopping 86.29% of their ill-gotten gains into Bitcoin. Let’s dive deep into this unfolding saga and understand the implications for the crypto world. Unmasking the Lazarus Group’s Bitcoin Strategy Imagine this: a shadowy organization, suspected to be North Korea’s Lazarus Group, pilfering a colossal sum of cryptocurrency and then expertly maneuvering it through the intricate web of the blockchain. According to Bybit CEO Ben Zhou’s report, this is precisely what has transpired. Out of the 440,091 ETH stolen, a staggering 86.29% has been transformed into 12,836 BTC. This conversion, spread across a staggering 9,117 different wallets, paints a picture of a highly organized and sophisticated operation. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key figures: Total Stolen Funds (Initially in ETH): 440,091 ETH Percentage Converted to Bitcoin: 86.29% Bitcoin Acquired: 12,836 BTC Wallets Involved: 9,117 This data underscores the sheer scale and meticulous planning behind this cryptocurrency theft . The Lazarus Group’s ability to convert such a massive amount of Ethereum into Bitcoin without triggering immediate alarms speaks volumes about their operational prowess and the challenges faced in tracking and recovering stolen crypto assets. Why Bitcoin? The Preferred Choice for Cybercriminals? Why did the Lazarus Group choose Bitcoin as their primary conversion target? Several factors could be at play: Liquidity and Acceptance: Bitcoin is the most liquid and widely accepted cryptocurrency globally. Its robust trading volume across numerous exchanges makes it easier to move large sums without significantly impacting the market. Established Infrastructure: Bitcoin’s mature infrastructure and longer history provide a more established and perhaps perceived as less traceable network compared to newer or less established cryptocurrencies. Anonymity Features: While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, various techniques, including mixers and tumblers, can be employed to enhance anonymity, making it harder to trace the flow of funds. The choice of Bitcoin highlights a crucial aspect of cryptocurrency theft – the end goal isn’t just stealing the assets but also laundering them effectively. Converting to Bitcoin, a more established and liquid cryptocurrency, is a strategic move in this direction. Diving into the Murky Waters of Crypto Mixers The report further reveals a concerning trend: the Lazarus Group is increasingly leveraging crypto mixers like Wasabi to obfuscate the trail of their illicit gains. A significant 193 BTC has already been processed through these mixers. But what exactly are crypto mixers, and why are they a headache for law enforcement and blockchain analysts? Crypto mixers, also known as tumblers, are services designed to break the link between the sender and receiver of cryptocurrency transactions. They work by pooling together various transactions and mixing them, making it exceedingly difficult to trace the origin and destination of specific funds. Wasabi Wallet, specifically mentioned in the report, is a Bitcoin wallet known for its privacy features, including coin mixing capabilities. Challenges Posed by Crypto Mixers: Enhanced Anonymity: Mixers significantly enhance the anonymity of transactions, making it exponentially harder to track the flow of stolen funds. Decentralization: Many mixers operate in a decentralized or semi-decentralized manner, making it challenging to shut them down or regulate their activities. Technical Complexity: Decoding mixer transactions requires advanced blockchain analysis techniques and expertise, posing a significant hurdle for investigators. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou’s call for experts to help decode these mixer transactions underscores the gravity of the situation. Unraveling the complexities of mixer transactions is now the biggest challenge in recovering the remaining stolen funds. The Silver Lining: Traceability and Frozen Assets Despite the Lazarus Group’s sophisticated methods, there’s a glimmer of hope. The report indicates that a substantial 88.87% of the stolen funds remain traceable. This means that while the hackers have been active, a significant portion of the loot is still within reach, at least in theory. Furthermore, 3.54% of the stolen funds have already been frozen, demonstrating that efforts to track and seize these assets are yielding some results. Key Positives: High Traceability Rate: 88.87% traceability offers a significant window of opportunity for recovery efforts. Successful Freezing: The 3.54% of frozen funds is a testament to the effectiveness of current tracking and seizure mechanisms. Increased Awareness: Reports like this from Bybit CEO raise crucial awareness within the crypto community and among regulatory bodies, prompting collaborative action. However, the race against time is on. The longer these funds remain untraced and unrecovered, the greater the risk of them being fully laundered and disappearing into the digital ether. Actionable Insights and the Path Forward What can be learned from this high-profile North Korea hackers incident, and what steps can be taken to mitigate future risks? For Cryptocurrency Exchanges: Enhanced Security Measures: Continuously upgrade security protocols, including multi-signature wallets, cold storage, and robust intrusion detection systems. Advanced Transaction Monitoring: Implement sophisticated blockchain analytics tools to detect and flag suspicious transaction patterns, including those associated with known mixers. Collaboration and Information Sharing: Foster greater collaboration with blockchain analysis firms, law enforcement agencies, and other exchanges to share threat intelligence and best practices. For Cryptocurrency Users: Due Diligence: Exercise caution when interacting with new or unverified crypto platforms and services. Security Best Practices: Employ strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and use hardware wallets for storing significant crypto holdings. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest security threats and vulnerabilities in the crypto space. The Lazarus Group’s audacious Bitcoin conversion serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing battle between innovation and exploitation in the cryptocurrency realm. While the decentralized and borderless nature of crypto offers immense opportunities, it also presents unique challenges in combating illicit activities. The crypto community, regulatory bodies, and law enforcement agencies must work in concert to develop more effective strategies for preventing, detecting, and responding to sophisticated cyber threats like those posed by the Lazarus Group. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Crypto World The revelation by Bybit CEO Ben Zhou is more than just a news update; it’s a urgent wake-up call for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Lazarus Group’s sophisticated tactics, particularly their adept use of Bitcoin conversion and crypto mixers, underscore the evolving nature of cybercrime in the digital age. While the high traceability rate and frozen assets offer a sliver of hope, the challenge of decoding mixer transactions remains a significant hurdle. The crypto world must heed this warning and double down on collaborative efforts to enhance security, improve transaction monitoring, and develop innovative solutions to stay one step ahead of these determined cyber adversaries. The fight against cryptocurrency theft is far from over, and vigilance is our strongest weapon.

Article 123: European equity funds see largest 4-week inflows of the decade as interest shifts from U.S. stocks
Content:
European equity funds recorded the largest four-week inflows in nearly the past 10 years, with European stocks outperforming U.S. stocks. European stocks are also seeing the latest weekly inflows recorded since February 2022, before the Russia-Ukraine war began. The surge is due to rising expectations that European governments will pour more funding into defense and infrastructure amid the U.S.’s pullback of its support for Ukraine. Bank of America Corp. data further revealed that money market funds attracted over $50 billion, gold attracted over $1 billion, stocks drew in over $22 billion, and bonds attracted over $12 billion. Emerging markets and technology stocks contributed to the large inflows experienced over the past few weeks. Passive fund inflows into European markets have further hit over $6 billion, marking the 10th consecutive week of inflows. Active funds have still seen more outflows this week, losing over $1.2 billion and marking the 43rd consecutive week of outflows. The funds have lost over $11 billion year-to-date. BofA strategist Michael Hartnett suggested that the current trend seen in European equity funds could continue to outperform U.S. funds, including the Stoxx 600 outperforming the S&P 500. BofA also mentioned that more investors expected European stocks and funds to maintain their strength throughout the year. The bank’s latest Fund Manager Survey indicated that 60% of investors believed in the positive health of European money markets and a sharp sentiment shift from U.S. markets. The survey also pointed out that the current sentiment shift from the U.S. to European markets is the sharpest rotation seen since 1999. 39% of investors currently hold overweight positions in European funds, compared to 12% recorded last month. 23% of investors also reported underweight positions in U.S. stocks, compared to 17% holding overweight positions last month. U.S. stocks may continue to underperform in the coming months The U.S. money markets have been struggling in the first months of President Trump’s administration due to the economic policies now viewed as less-than-favorable. The BofA survey indicated that investors were dumping the U.S. stocks at the fastest rate ever seen, supported by the recent 40-percent-point reduction in investors’ hold on long positions on U.S. stocks. The downturn has benefited other regions, especially Europe and China. Market indices for the U.S. money markets have also been underperforming, with the Nasdaq Industrial Composite, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Index all dropping over the past few weeks. The indices saw recovery during the weekend for the first time in several weeks but opened lower on Monday as investors failed to maintain the upward momentum. The reversed momentum has also raised speculation that more Wall Street sell-offs are to be expected in the near future. Deutsche Bank chief strategist Bankhim Chadha recently mentioned that there would be more sell-offs in U.S. equities before the indices recovered, stating the possibility of the S&P 500 recovering by 24%. Morgan Stanley’s chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, also mentioned that there would not be a sustainable rally for a while. The Fund Manager Survey revealed that 69% of fund managers believed that U.S. stock exceptionalism was ending. The sentiment has also created concerns that U.S. stocks will continue to underperform in the coming months. Goldman Sachs analyst Peter Oppenheimer recently warned that U.S. capital markets had shifted from high to moderate performance. Oppenheimer further commented on the current shift toward other regions’ funds, adding that Trump’s policies could drive the shift further. European active ETFs receive more attention from ETF investors The ongoing economic concerns in the U.S. have also shifted ETF investors from U.S.-based ETFs to European active ETFs. The European active ETFs industry is projected to grow to over $1 trillion in assets under management in the coming years. Wall Street asset management firms, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sach Asset Management, and BlackRock Inc., have expressed interest in launching active ETFs on European exchanges. European Ucits ETFs have also seen a surge in inflows in the past month, with over 33 billion euros flowing into the funds, marking a 16% increase compared to January. U.S.-based crypto ETFs have seen massive outflows over the past few weeks following the continued economic uncertainty in the country. U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs shed $5.5 billion in the past 5 weeks, with Trump’s tariffs driving investors away from riskier assets. The massive outflows notably began after Trump’s entry into office in January, with recent crypto-friendly news failing to drive interest in the ETFs. Cryptocurrencies have also been underperforming, with CryptoQuant’s Ki Young Ju recently suggesting that the bull run was over. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Article 124: BTC, ETH, XRP Price Prediction as S&P 500 Index Rockets, Gold Hits ATH
Content:
Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) prices rose modestly on Thursday after Jerome Powell’s transitory statement on inflation. BTC price retested the important resistance at $86,000, while ETH rose to $2,000 and XRP price hit $2.5. So, how will these blue-chip crypto market coins react as the S&P 500 index and gold prices surge? S&P 500 Index and Gold Prices Are Soaring Popular players in the crypto market, like BTC, ETH, and XRP may benefit from the ongoing surge of other risky assets. The S&P 500 index, which tracks the biggest US companies, rose to $5,700, up by over 3% from the lowest point this month. Popular American indices like the Dow Jones and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 have also jumped. At the same time, gold price has continued surging this year and is sitting at its all-time high. It has jumped in the last three consecutive weeks, making it one of the year’s best-performing assets. US stocks and gold continued rising after the Fed interest rate decision . The bank decided to leave interest rates unchanged and hinted that it would start tapering its quantitive tightening (QT) process. Most notably, Jerome Powell said that Trump tariff would cause transitory inflation, meaning that the bank would consider delivering more rate cuts this year. Mohamed El-Erian blasted that view, saying : “ I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility . It’s simply too early to say with any regress of confidence that the inflationary effects will be transitory.” The soaring S&P 500 index and gold prices are bullish for crypto prices like BTC, ETH, and XRP since these assets have some correlation. BTC Price Technical Analysis While the ongoing S&P 500 index and gold price rally is positive for the BTC price, technicals point to uncertainties ahead. The main risk is that Bitcoin price has formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages crossed each other. Bitcoin has also formed a rising wedge, which is made up of two ascending and converging trendlines. It often leads to a bearish breakout. As CoinGape wrote earlier, Bitcoin key liquidation levels point to more downside. If this happens, the most likely scenario is where BTC price crashes to $73,587, the highest point in March last year. BTC price Chart ETH Price Technical Analysis While ETH price has bounced back from the lowest point this month, it remains below the important resistance point at $2,138. This is a crucial level since it was the neckline of the triple-top pattern at $4,000. The bearish ETH price forecast will remain as long as it is below that resistance level and the 50-day moving average at $2,300. More downside will be confirmed Ethereum price drops below $1,763. ETH Price Chart XRP Price Technical Analysis Ripple price rose after the end of the SEC vs Ripple case . However, it is notable that the coin has struggled to move above the resistance at $3, which is its make-or-break level. A clear bullish outlook will be confirmed if it rises above that level since it is the right and left shoulders of the head and shoulders pattern. Therefore, there is a risk that it will resume the downtrend as investors sell the fact. A drop to $1 will be confirmed if it crashes below $1.9, the neckline. XRP price chart Summary The crypto market, US stocks, and gold prices rose after the Fed decision. However, crypto prices like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP may struggle to sustain those gains, leading to an eventual crash.

Article 127: Chainlink (LINK) on the Brink: Critical Levels to Watch Now
Content:
Chainlink (LINK) is struggling with volatility, trading at $14.46 after a failed breakout at $15.17. The price initially climbed within an ascending triangle on the 1-hour chart but faced sharp rejection at resistance, triggering a pullback. Now, LINK is testing the $14.40 support zone, a key battleground for buyers. Key Levels to Watch A drop below $14.40 could accelerate selling, pushing LINK toward $14.20. Losing this level may break the ascending triangle’s trendline support, shifting momentum bearish and increasing downside risk. If buyers defend $14.40, a rebound toward $15.17 is likely. A breakout above this resistance would reverse the failed breakout, turning sentiment bullish. If momentum builds, LINK could target $17.40, a critical resistance for confirming a larger uptrend. Breakout Potential A decisive move above $17.40 could spark a long-term rally , attracting more buyers and strengthening market confidence. This scenario would favor both short-term traders and long-term holders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Outlook The fight at $14.40 will dictate LINK’s next move. A breakdown risks further losses, while a strong rebound could trigger a push toward $17.40 and beyond. With volatility rising, traders should watch these levels closely.

Article 130: Has Bitcoin Really Entered a Bear Market? Analyst Weighs In
Content:
Bitcoin’s recent price movement has sparked debate among analysts over whether the original cryptocurrency has entered a bear market. Renowned analyst Ali Martinez recently shared an in-depth analysis assessing Bitcoin’s (BTC) trend using multiple technical indicators and on-chain data. In his study, Martinez suggested that while BTC might be shifting into a bearish phase, certain factors could still support a recovery. Key Indicators Signal Bearish Momentum First, Martinez highlighted the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse, a metric tracking Bitcoin movement between spot and derivative exchanges. According to the analyst, BTC is currently in a “corrective phase,” often marked by declining prices or stabilization after a strong rally. Bitcoin has corrected 23% from its peak of over $109,000 in late January during President Donald Trump’s inauguration. He also pointed to the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Ratio, which has turned negative—a historical signal of weakening momentum. Additionally, his Market Cycle Indicator suggests that Bitcoin could be in the early stages of a bear market, aligning with past downturns. Further evidence comes from large investor activity, particularly among miners and whales. On-chain data shared by Martinez showed that miners recently sold over $27 million in bitcoin profits, which often signals a shift toward caution in the market. Meanwhile, whale activity shows that major BTC holders have liquidated more than $260 million, adding to overall selling pressure. Compounding these concerns is a sharp decline in capital inflows—new investments entering Bitcoin. Monthly inflows have dropped significantly from $135 billion in December 2024 to just $4 billion on March 18, 2025, indicating weaker demand and a potential lack of fresh buying power. Can Bitcoin Hold Key Support Levels? Despite these bearish signals, Martinez identified key support levels that could stabilize Bitcoin’s price. According to the analyst, the $66,000–$69,000 range has emerged as a crucial zone where buyers might step in. To back this, Martinez shared a chart from IntoTheBlock that shows that 750,000 investors purchased 313,000 BTC around the $69,000 price range. He also shared Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution, which suggests strong support near $69,354—further reinforcing the idea that Bitcoin could find a floor in this range. Moreover, he pointed out that the Mayer Multiple and Bitcoin’s position relative to its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) suggests $66,000 as another critical level to watch. However, Martinez mentioned a potential bullish scenario tied to global liquidity. According to his analysis, rising liquidity levels have historically helped BTC recover, pointing to April as a possible turning point. If the leading crypto asset manages to reclaim $93,700 as support, it could signal a renewed uptrend, with a potential move toward $111,000, Martinez said. Despite these bearish concerns, BTC surged 4% to enter a 10-day high of $85,900 following the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady.

Article 131: Solana (SOL) holders are rushing toward this emerging DeFi coin for massive gains
Content:
As the DeFi market continues to expand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been gaining attention from investors looking for fresh opportunities. With a structured presale model, a rapidly growing user base, and a lending ecosystem designed for long-term sustainability, Mutuum Finance is becoming a strong alternative for those looking beyond traditional crypto assets like Solana (SOL). Why Solana holders are looking elsewhere Solana has been a dominant force in the blockchain space, offering high-speed transactions and low fees. However, as the market matures, investors are exploring new projects with higher growth potential. While Solana’s technology remains strong, its price movement has slowed, and competition in the DeFi space is increasing. This shift in investor behavior has led many SOL holders to diversify their portfolios, seeking out opportunities that offer better entry points and stronger upside potential. Mutuum Finance has positioned itself as a project that not only offers utility but also an early-stage advantage, attracting investors eager to participate in a protocol designed for sustainable growth. The project’s decentralized, non-custodial lending system enables users to supply assets and earn yield while borrowers can access capital through overcollateralized loans. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has already secured over $4 million in funding, with more than 6,200 holders participating in its presale. The token is currently in Phase 3 at $0.02, with the next phase set to increase the price to $0.025—a 25% jump. With 11 total presale phases and a launch price of $0.06, early investors are securing their positions before further price increases. This structured presale model creates consistent upward momentum, giving investors a clear roadmap for price appreciation. Unlike established cryptocurrencies that often rely on unpredictable market conditions, Mutuum Finance has a built-in growth mechanism that rewards early investors and fosters long-term participation. Mutuum Finance is built for decentralized lending, offering dynamic interest rates that adjust based on liquidity pool activity. Users receive mtTokens, which grow in value over time, ensuring a continuous yield. Unlike speculative assets, MUTM has a clear use case within its lending ecosystem, creating sustained demand. Additionally, the platform employs a buy-and-distribute model, using a portion of protocol fees to support MUTM’s price stability and long-term growth. Mutuum Finance has also launched a $100,000 giveaway, offering participants a chance to win MUTM tokens. This initiative aims to encourage broader engagement and strengthen the ecosystem by attracting new users. The giveaway is designed to be accessible to all participants, with winners selected from those actively engaging with the platform, presale contributors, and community members. Is Mutuum Finance the next big move for DeFi investors? With Solana holders actively looking for new opportunities, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a clear choice for those who want to be part of an ecosystem with a defined growth plan. The early-stage investment potential, structured price appreciation, and DeFi-focused utilities make it an appealing option for investors who understand the importance of getting in at the right time. As more phases of the presale are completed and the token price continues to rise, Mutuum Finance is solidifying its position in the market. Investors who recognize the value of early adoption in DeFi protocols are making their move now, securing their MUTM holdings before the project’s full-scale launch. With a strong foundation, increasing demand, and real-world utility, Mutuum Finance is proving to be more than just a trending token—it’s shaping up to be one of the most promising projects in the DeFi space.

Content:
Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Asian investors are shifting from Tron and Binance Coin to newer projects. XYZVerse, a rising sports memecoin with explosive growth potential, is capturing investor attention. Table of Contents XYZVerse: Could this memecoin deliver 50x returns? Tron stagnates Binance Coin fluctuates Conclusion Prominent investors in Asia are reportedly offloading significant holdings of Tron and Binance Coin. At the same time, a lot of attention has shifted to an obscure altcoin priced at a fraction of a cent, which is rumored to have massive growth potential. This unexpected move is stirring curiosity in the crypto community as the details behind this hidden gem begin to emerge. XYZVerse: Could this memecoin deliver 50x returns? The excitement around XYZVerse isn’t just noise; it’s a genuine phenomenon. As the pioneering all-sports meme token, XYZVerse is rapidly bridging the gap between sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, sparking major interest. Unlike typical memecoins that thrive solely on fleeting trends, XYZVerse is carving out its own niche. By merging the exhilarating world of sports with the contagious energy of meme culture, XYZVerse has captured significant momentum. The presale is accelerating, allowing early adopters to secure tokens at prices far below their anticipated future value. Currently, XYZVerse remains in its presale stage, but investor demand is already high. The token’s price has impressively surged from an initial $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, and over 70% of the $15 million presale target has been achieved. With a final projected presale price of $0.1, early participants are set for significant returns. XYZVerse’s popularity is evident on CoinMarketCap, where the community sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. With a remarkable 95% of voters forecasting further growth for XYZ, optimism is undeniably high. Influential crypto figures have also noticed XYZVerse’s potential. Crypto influencer DanjoCapitalMaster, who boasts nearly 800,000 followers, recently labeled XYZVerse as a “moonshot opportunity.” While the crypto market always involves risks, the buzz surrounding XYZVerse is undeniably strong. Beyond mere speculation, XYZVerse boasts structured and sustainable tokenomics. A significant 15% allocation to liquidity ensures robust market foundations, while another 10% is set aside for community rewards through airdrops and bonuses. Additionally, a substantial 17.13% of the supply is earmarked for deflationary burns, potentially enhancing token scarcity and value. What truly distinguishes XYZVerse is its emphasis on community involvement. Through initiatives like the Ambassador Program, supporters can earn tokens by actively promoting the project. Furthermore, discussions with prominent sports celebrities are underway, aiming to amplify XYZVerse’s visibility. By uniting passionate sports communities with the dynamic crypto ecosystem, XYZVerse is crafting an engaging and entertaining experience. Backed by a rapidly growing presale, enthusiastic community, and ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse possesses all the elements of a memecoin poised for explosive growth. While crypto markets are inherently unpredictable, savvy investors recognize the opportunity to participate early in a potentially promising project. With the presale window rapidly closing, the time to explore XYZVerse might be now. You might also like: XYZVerse, the Shiba Inu alternative with a burning mechanism, poised to hit $1 Tron stagnates TRON (TRX) has been active lately. In the past week, its price rose by 3.84%. Over the last month, it dipped by 3.93%. Looking at the past six months, TRX surged by 53.66%, showing strong growth over time. Currently, TRX trades between $0.20 and $0.23. The 10-day moving average is $0.24, while the 100-day average is $0.22. This places the price below the short-term average but above the long-term one. The Relative Strength Index stands at 55.83, indicating a neutral market stance. The MACD level is 0.0037, hinting at slight bullish momentum. The nearest resistance level is $0.25. If TRX breaks through, it could reach $0.27, which is about a 17% increase from current levels. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.19. If the price falls below this, it might drop to $0.17, roughly a 13% decrease. With the stochastic at 50.57, the market seems balanced. TRX could move upward if buying interest grows. Binance Coin fluctuates BNB has shown mixed performance recently. In the past week, its price jumped by 11.81%, indicating short-term bullishness. However, over the last month, it declined by 8.29%. Over six months, there’s an overall increase of 8.81%, reflecting moderate long-term growth. Trading between $532.97 and $647.57, BNB is approaching the nearest resistance at $692.63. A break above this could target the second resistance at $807.23, implying a potential gain of around 25%. If the price falls below the support at $463.43, it might drop to $348.83, representing a decrease of about 35%. Technical indicators are sending cautious signals. The RSI is at 39.37, nearing oversold territory, suggesting a possible rebound. The Stochastic indicator is low at 20.51, also pointing to overselling. However, the MACD level is negative at -3.1273, indicating bearish momentum. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages are close, showing a lack of clear trend direction. Based on these factors, BNB’s future movement is uncertain, but a significant breakout could occur soon. Conclusion Though TRX and BNB remain strong, investors are turning to XYZVerse, a pioneering sports memecoin poised for significant growth in the 2025 bull market.

Article 135: Ethereum Sepolia Testnet Faces Issues—Is DuragDoge the Real Winner of This Shift?
Content:
The post Ethereum Sepolia Testnet Faces Issues—Is DuragDoge the Real Winner of This Shift? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum (ETH) is on a prolonged downward trend, causing crypto users to wonder what is happening with the market’s second-largest crypto. Ethereum’s dip has incurred significant losses for its holders, with about 70% of ETH addresses clearly out of money. The token is plunging even deeper despite the network’s activity, such as the Pectra upgrade deployed on the Sepolia testnet to increase ETH’s worth. Despite the bear market, DuragDoge ($DURAG) is the real winner right now. Its features equip it with the resilience and longevity it needs to beat market conditions, so analysts rank it as the best cryptocurrency. The $DURAG token is among the best crypto pre-sales right now, and it continues to hit new records with its utility-driven features. Read on to discover why $DURAG is ten steps ahead in the game. Ethereum (ETH) Still in the Dip as its New Upgrade on Sepolia Testnet Faces Issues Ethereum’s most anticipated upgrade, Pectra , was deployed on its final testnet on March 5. The upgrade marks a significant milestone towards Ethereum’s goal of achieving the mainnet activation. Pectra has received immense support from community members, who hope the upgrade will boost ETH’s value. The upgrade also aims to improve Ethereum’s network activity and scalability. However, Pectra has yet to live up to its promises, as the developers encounter a hurdle on the Sepolia testnet. Tim Beiko , Ethereum Protocol Support Lead, said the problem is due to a custom deposit contract on Sepolia. This caused execution layer (EL) clients to face issues such as transaction delays within blocks. With this issue onboard, the mainnet activation launch date might be postponed, killing token holders’ hopes. This also means the ETH token might continue to plummet, as the upgrade was supposed to cause ETH to rally. The dip is affecting investors and token holders, as data from IntoTheBlock shows only about 26% of ETH addresses are making slight profits. This means that over 70% of Ethereum addresses have lost everything. No wonder holders are shifting to $DURAG, one of the best crypto coins to invest in. DuragDoge ($DURAG) Rallies, Emerges as the New Token With the Highest Potential DuragDoge is the new hot deal in the crypto market. It tops the chart as the best cryptocurrency to buy now. DuragDoge is a new meme coin with revolutionary features that will shake the meme coin sector. Its token, $DURAG, is fortified with features that will promote the hustle culture, reflect members’ identity and creativity, drape members with the ultimate drip, and promote longevity. DuragDoge is headed for the global stage while creating an ecosystem that supports staking and other developments that benefit token holders. These features place $DURAG many steps ahead of other meme coins, which is why it is currently recording one of the best crypto presales. $DURAG’s presales aim to give everyone early access to this golden token. This is why 1,240,000,000 $DURAG tokens are available at exclusive rates. The $DURAG token is gathering interest from crypto whales and users as it is one of the best crypto coins to invest in. DuragDoge ($DURAG) Gains Whales’ Approval With its Reward Features The $DURAG token is gaining widespread adoption due to its reward features that increase holders’ gains. One of $DURAG’s most profitable features is the staking and reward. Holders who stake their $DURAGs will earn up to 20% APY in rewards, boosting their portfolios significantly. There will be community incentives, where members receive rewards for their activeness and creativity in DuragDoge’s ecosystem. There will also be periodic burns to assure holders and investors of $DURAG’s security and longevity. These burns will regulate $DURAG’s circulation, making it a deflationary token whose value will continue to rise. Conclusion With many changes in the crypto market, DuragDoge might be the new leading crypto. The $DURAG token continues to see increased adoption, with the presales surging beyond expectations.

Article 137: Are Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) Staging a Comeback? Top 3 Memecoins Analyzed
Content:
The entire crypto market cap (excluding BTC) is up around 14% since a potential bottom was hit last week. Memecoins have also taken part in this recovery. The top 3 memecoins by market cap are analysed. Are $DOGE, $SHIB, and $PEPE making a comeback? Total2 will signal altcoin rally or rejection Source: TradingView Total2 is the chart of the combined market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies, excluding $BTC. Therefore it enables a reasonable assessment of how the altcoins are doing in general. It can be seen that a minor rally is currently taking place. For this rally to really take off, the descending trendline will have to be broken, and higher highs will need to be made. If this does take place, expect some of the prominent memecoins to take advantage. $DOGE potentially finds a bottom Source: TradingView The daily chart for $DOGE does show that this $25.5 billion memecoin may have finally found a bottom. The price was able to bounce from the ascending trendline, which was perhaps the very bottom, and is now battling to stay above the 0.786, the deepest of the Fibonacci retracement levels. A big plus is that the bulls have broken through the descending trendline. The price may be coming back down to retest this, possibly at $0.16 before going higher. If the bottom is indeed in for $DOGE, potential bounces from the indicators in the RSI, and Stochastic RSI, could help to get a powerful rally started. $SHIB in favourable position Source: TradingView The $SHIB price does look to be in a favourable position in the weekly chart. The bulls have forced it through the descending trendline, and the price is currently maintaining at the major horizontal support level. With the Stochastic RSI indicators on this time frame inclining upward from the bottom, all would appear to be perfect for a rally from here. That said, the support and the trendline would have to hold, and Bitcoin would need to take the lead. Important targets are at $0.000016, and then $$0.000021. Horizontal support proves its worth for $PEPE Source: TradingView $PEPE can probably be classed as a true memecoin, because all it has backing it is the air that we breathe. Even so, it has a market cap of more than $3 billion, and the price appears to be recovering nicely so far. The horizontal support at $0.000006 has proved its worth, and the price has bounced from there. Targets, according to the Fibonacci levels, are in the chart above.

Article 138: Pi Network Nears $1.20 Test on March 21: Will It Break the Barrier?
Content:
Pi Network struggles to break $1.20 resistance despite a bullish price trend. Falling trading volume raises concerns about PI’s short-term market momentum. Exchange resistance and KYC deadline add uncertainty to PI’s price outlook. Pi Network (PI) has shown some fight in its recent price action, but it’s heading into a critical resistance level around March 21st. Right now, the token sits at $1.18 , which is a 4.79% jump over the last 24 hours. Even with this price bump, the amount of PI traded in the last 24 hours has dropped by a significant 32.90% to $361.2 million. This dip in trading activity might mean that market players are being a bit cautious. On the other hand, the total value of all PI out there (market cap) has risen by 4.34% to $8.06 billion, suggesting that overall investor confidence is still holding up. Key Levels for PI Traders to Watch For traders keeping an eye on PI, there are some important price levels to note. The strongest area of support seems to be around $1.12, which was the lowest point recently. There’s also another support zone between $1.14 and $1.15, where the price has often consolidated before making upward mov… The post Pi Network Nears $1.20 Test on March 21: Will It Break the Barrier? appeared first on Coin Edition .

Solana ( SOL ) price is up today, buoyed by a significant recovery in the broader cryptocurrency market. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows SOL’s price is trading at around $134, up more than 6% in the last 24 hours. Solana price has rebounded roughly 20% from its local low of around $112 reached on March 11. SOL/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Several factors driving the SOL price up today, including: SOL price rally comes following the launch of the first Solana futures ETF. Approximately $18 million in shorts were liquidated over the last 24 hours. SOL’s strengthening technicals target is $220. Launch of Solana futures ETF boosts SOL price Today’s debut of Solana futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) by Volatility Shares has injected fresh enthusiasm into SOL investors. 🚨 BREAKING: The first-ever Solana futures ETFs are launching tomorrow. Volatility Shares is debuting two ETFs: • SOLZ: Tracks Solana futures • SOLT: Offers 2x leveraged exposure pic.twitter.com/Wt2gt6oBPc — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 19, 2025 Key takeaways: Volatility Shares, a US-based investment firm, is set to launch the first-ever Solana futures ETFs on Thursday, March 20. A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reveals that two Solana-based ETFs issued by Volatility Shares ETFs will begin trading on Thursday, March 20. These include Solana ETF (SOLZ), which will track Solana futures and the Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT), which offers leveraged exposure. SOLZ will have a management fee of 0.95%, while traders will be charged 1.85% for SOLT. The ETFs, following a path similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures products, signal growing institutional acceptance and provide easier access for traditional investors. Market participants believe that the launch of these funds could be significant in the approval of a spot Solana ETF . Several issuers, including Grayscale , Franklin Templeton and VanEck , have applied for spot Solana ETFs, which are yet to be approved by the SEC. Bloomberg ETF analysts believe there is a 75% chance of approval by this year’s end. Analysts see this as a regulatory green light, boosting confidence in Solana and across the broader market. “​​Solana ETF dropping right after BTC/ETH ETFs? The TradFi gates are opening wide,” said crypto analyst Kolin in a March 19 post on X. “Futures are just the start - spot ETF inevitable. $SOL's just warming up and the Solana ecosystem’s about to get flooded with institutional liquidity.” “This is wild,” asserted Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas in response to the developments, adding that it is probably a good sign as Solana futures “arguably bode well for spot ETF odds.” Short liquidations push SOL price higher Solana’s price rise on March 20 is accompanied by significant liquidations in the derivatives market, according to data from CoinGlass. The crypto futures market witnessed the liquidation of over $359 million worth of leverage positions in the last 24 hours, with $258.7 million being short liquidations. Over $18.64 million short SOL positions have been liquidated against $3 million long liquidations over the same period. Total crypto liquidations. Source: CoinGlass Bearish traders’ short positions are automatically closed when the price exceeds their liquidation price, which can fuel the rally further. Furthermore, the SOL price gains accompany a recovery in its funding rates . SOL’s 8-hour funding rates have flipped positive from -0.0050% on March 19 to 0.0049% on March 20, as shown in the chart below. SOL funding rates performance. Source: CoinGlass A rise in funding rates indicates increased demand for long positions and increased interest among SOL traders.

However, the bulls have established support around $110 and $125 at the upper boundary of a descending channel. The daily relative strength index (RSI) has recorded higher highs since March 10 with no divergence, indicating that the upward momentum remains strong. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The next immediate barrier sits at $140, which, if broken, SOL price would rise higher to confront resistance from the $165 to $190 supply zone—this is around where all the major moving averages sit. Bulls will be required to flip this area into support to increase the chances of rising toward $220, where the price could pause for a while. According to analyst Cryptobits, SOL’s recent low at $112 marked the local bottom for the altcoin. He added that Solana’s fundamentals remain strong, with increasing “investment interests from institutions” supporting its upside. “With all the above remaining intact, I see $SOL returning above $200 and eventually breaking its ATH high at $296.” This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Article 144: Fired Democrat FTC commissioner warns of the ‘corrupting influence of billionaires’
Content:
Former Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya believes President Donald Trump’s decision to fire the agency’s two remaining Democratic members serves the interests of powerful billionaires rather than the American people. Speaking before the Colorado state legislature Wednesday, Bedoya said the dismissals would suppress fair market oversight and undermine the work of independent regulatory agencies. “ I think we need to be focused on the billionaires over President Trump’s shoulder at his inauguration and what this attempt will do for them ,” Bedoya said. “ Above all else, we need to be asking ourselves, who will win from this attempt to illegally remove us, and frankly, who will lose? ” Bedoya: Trump firing Democratic party-aligned commissioners is illegal As reported by Cryptopolitan on March 19, Bedoya and fellow Democratic Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter were fired on Tuesday evening, an action they have coined “illegal and unlawful.” Their removal appears to violate legal precedent that restricts a president from firing FTC commissioners without cause. The following day, in a CNBC interview, Slaughter cautioned that the dismissals breach government agencies’ ability to work independently. “ This isn’t just about the FTC, and it’s not about my job ,” Slaughter said on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street . “ This is about policing the ability of the FTC to police markets and ensure honest businesses are protected instead of allowing companies that lie and cheat to get ahead. ” Slaughter also asked if the firings could be extended to other independent agencies or if it was just a ploy to take out the liberals from the agency. “ If I can be fired, I don’t know why Jerome Powell can’t be fired ,” referring to the Federal Reserve chairman. “ As head of the executive branch, President Trump is vested with all of the executive power in our government ,” said FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson, defending Trump’s decision. “I have no doubts about his constitutional authority to remove Commissioners, which is necessary to ensure democratic accountability for our government. ” Washington has not specified the reasons for the dismissals, but White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Trump is exercising his “lawful authority” to manage personnel. “ President Trump will continue to rid the federal government of bad actors unaligned with his common sense agenda the American people decisively voted for ,” Rogers remarked. Is Trump protecting his tech friends? Bedoya asserted that his firing may be linked to his statements on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Bezos, along with other tech executives such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, stood behind Trump at his inauguration on January 20. “ I issued a statement criticizing Mr Bezos for working his people and warehouses so fast, so hard that they literally have to put up vending machines on the warehouse floor, dispensing and capping the amount of painkillers each of those workers has to get, ” Bedoya told Colorado lawmakers. Mr. Bezos, when I think about “free markets and personal liberties” I don’t think about the Post editorial page. I think about this vending machine in an Amazon Fulfillment Center, which is stocked not with chips but with painkillers. https://t.co/emxXutsDzP pic.twitter.com/R1pMOHz3Aj — Alvaro Bedoya (@BedoyaFTC) February 28, 2025 Although he didn’t directly accuse Bezos of having influenced his dismissal, Bedoya said the timing of his firing was “interesting.” “ I’m not alleging that this was why I was fired, but I think it’s an interesting coincidence .” The FTC has also been investigating Amazon, Meta, and X, which the ex-commissioner revealed he had been working on. “ I stress an uncomfortable fact, which is that the issue of the corrupting influence of money in politics, I don’t think, is limited to one party . So I think we need to take a step back and ask ourselves, who will win from this effort to remove us? ” he inquired. Bipartisan concerns and the Senate pushback More than two dozen Democratic senators have called on Trump to reinstate the fired commissioners. In a letter signed on Tuesday by Senators Amy Klobuchar, Dick Durbin, and Maria Cantwell, among others, they argued that Trump is ignoring the FTC’s independence. “ This action contradicts Congress’s constitutional authority to create bipartisan, independent commissions and upends more than 110 years of work at the FTC to protect consumers from deceptive practices and monopoly power, ” the senators wrote. “ We urge you to rescind these dismissals so the FTC can get back to the people’s work .” Still, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt swatted away concerns about any legal repercussions, saying the removals were well within the US president’s authority. “ They were given ample notice in a letter that I believe your outlet reported on, ” Leavitt reckoned. When asked if the administration’s goal was to overturn the 1935 Supreme Court ruling that protects the independence of commissions, she responded, “ The goal was to let these individuals go. If we have to fight it all the way to the Supreme Court, we certainly will. ” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Article 145: Uranium Digital Raises $6.1M to Speed Debut of Crypto-Powered Spot Market
Content:
Alex Dolesky thought his startup's push to "financialize" the sleepy uranium spot market would be a hit as nuclear energy stages a global comeback. All that tokenized yellowcake's looking more like gold. Months after netting its first $1.7 million from venture investors, Uranium Digital raised another $6.1 million in a seed round led by Framework Ventures. The financing will accelerate Uranium Digital's buildout of a spot trading platform for uranium that uses crypto infrastructure on the backend. It claims to be the first institutional market — crypto-powered or not — for a critical clean-energy commodity that, perplexingly, doesn't enjoy the same easy trading of its dirtier peers, coal, natural gas and oil. A radioactive mix of high regulations and low mainstream demand previously stymied the emergence of a robust uranium spot market, Dolesky said in an interview. While the strict rules over who can take settlement of yellowcake, a powdered form of uranium oxide concentrate, aren't going anywhere, the global demand for nuclear energy is taking care of the rest. Nuclear power is on its comeback tour. The energy source once derided by unfortunate disasters — most recently the Fukushima meltdown — is cropping up as a salve for rapidly increasing electric needs. The surge is fueling newfound interest from investors and institutions for an accessible spot market. In crypto Dolesky said he's found an efficient avenue to create the first. He says he's "abstracting away" the usual pain points of on-chain trading so that Uranium Digital will look and feel familiar for institutional clients. "Crypto rails for efficiency, speed and execution purposes — it's a unique opportunity," he said. As the platform nears its launch date Dolesky plans to pour more capital into his business and engineering teams. He realized after the pre-seed that the company's proposed solution had an even deeper well of potential users than what he called his most optimistic projections. Meeting the excess demand meant moving faster and raising more money. "The response we've gotten from the traditional market has been such that we're effectively going live sooner than anticipated," he said.
Article 146: Bitlayer has finally bridged BitVM to the world stage
Content:
Co-founders Charlie Hu and Kevin He started Bitlayer as a research-oriented passion project based on the BitVM paradigm, quickly spearheading the effort into an opportunity to unlock immense liquidity in the Bitcoin asset and ecosystem. Funnelling their extensive experience leading international teams to global success at Polygon, Polkadot, and Huobi, the two turned Bitlayer into the most relevant Bitcoin L2 in the space. In July 2024, Bitlayer announced its $11M Series A round led by Franklin Templeton and ABCDE. By October of the same year the team had raised an extended Series A round securing $9M more in funding, this time led by Polychain Capital. In less than a year’s time following the raise announcements, the team at Bitlayer has made staggering progress. Since the launch of its V1 mainnet, the project reached an all-time high TVL of 850 million with over 200 Dapps launched on the L2. Bitlayer’s ecosystem is growing and thriving with projects building Bitcoin DeFi (BTC-Fi) applications, ranging from BTC dexes, staking, restaking and liquid staking, infra, oracles, interoperability, data availability, and runes and ordinals, amongst many others. Recently, the team announced the first BitVM bridge solution testnet built in the Bitcoin ecosystem. “The bridge is an absolute necessity for Defi to happen on Bitcoin, ” said Charlie Hu, Co-founder of Bitlayer. “The main differentiator when compared to previous solutions is the trust assumption. The existing multisig set-up requires the majority of signers to be honest; if it happens that the majority of signers are malicious then the bridge becomes insecure, which is what happened during some of the major hacks we’ve seen lately in the space. Our bridging solution is trust-minimized which means that only one signer needs to be honest in order for the bridge to be secure.” The BitVM trust-minimized bridge enables the flow of bitcoin to an array of blockchains and decentralized applications. The recent announcement of Bitlayer’s partnerships with key Layer 1 blockchains such as Base, Arbitrum, Starknet, Sonic SVM, and Plume Network signal rising demand and interest. Now, with the imminent launch of Bitlayer Mainnet V2 in Q2 2025, Bitlayer is finally bringing BitVM to the world stage. “ T he Bitlayer network’s Mainnet V2 is set to transition to a Bitcoin Rollup, a first-of-its-kind innovation in the market, bringing Bitcoin-level security to the Layer 2 ecosystem,” says Kevin He, Bitlayer Co-founder. BitVM allows for trust-minimized deployment of Bitcoin into a host of blockchains, DeFi protocols, and decentralized applications in order to earn yield, staking rewards, lending and borrowing features, and much more. The BitVM paradigm does not require a fork to the Bitcoin protocol, and instead provides a technical solution built with zero-knowledge proofs, rollup architecture, and trust-minimized bridging. Institutional investors, OGs, whales, traders, and holders can deploy their Bitcoin to earn yield rewards, in a non-custodial, trust-minimized way. And so Bitlayer continues its vision to untap Bitcoin’s full Defi potential, teaming up with clients, community, and ecosystem partners to make history for Bitcoin.

Article 147: 4 USA Coins to Buy Ahead of Trump’s Crypto Summit Speech
Content:
Following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting the crypto market demonstrates a new upward trend. Interest rate maintenance by the Fed resulted in increased pricing across most cryptocurrency markets. The Made in USA market achieved $423 billion in market value through its 6% daily market expansion. The value of several USA coins to buy has strongly increased as Trump prepares to give his crypto summit address. Best USA Coins To Buy Now Ahead of Crypto Summit Speech At the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit in New York, President Donald Trump will provide a recorded communication. The appearance of President Donald Trump at the cryptocurrency conference represents his debut as a speaking president at such an industry gathering. The hype surrounding the event stems from signs that suggest the Trump administration could potentially back cryptocurrencies, specifically stablecoins. Among the USA coins to purchase are XRP, ADA, LINK, and SOL. Tweet Ripple (XRP) XRP price is among the top USA coins to buy after a strong market recovery. XRP token experienced a surge of over 10% during the day and emerged among the highest performers of the day. Ripple currently trades at $2.50 as analysts predict it will rise to $3 provided its bullish market conditions continue. After the Federal Open Market Committee decision on previous day, Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced positive market trends. XRP continues to capture attention from market participants as Trump prepares to address the crypto summit which drives investors to consider its potential influence on the market. Source: TradingView Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) experienced a 5% increase during the past day which lifted its value to $0.7327. The ADA crypto follows an upward trend which shows growing strength because it aims to reach $1. An ascending value trend has gained notice before important market events such as the Crypto Summit speech from Trump. The most recent data shows Cardano (ADA) experienced substantial growth in its trading volume. Within the recent 24-hour period, whales purchased 190 million ADA tokens. The increase in purchase demand stemming from whales might result in market price growth due to their established trend-setting power in the market. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) enters a positive direction with US investors seeing their first Solana ETFs debut today. The price of Solana has rebounded while trading over the crucial $130 support threshold. SOL has achieved a 10% rise in value throughout the past 24 hours making it one of the prime USA coins to purchase at present.

The Solana derivatives market continues to expand rapidly based on CoinGlass data. The total volume has expanded by 81.02% to achieve $8.63 billion. Open interest increased by 2.26% while reaching $3.86 billion and the change matches the current statistics. The rising market participation levels have led to increased trading volume and interest which might impact Solana’s price volatility. Source- Coinglass Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink price is among the top USA coins to buy after a notable recovery over the past 24 hours. The LINK price followed the crypto market bullish trend after the FOMC decision on the previous day. As of the reporting time, the LINK price is trading at $14.05, with a 5% surge in the past 24-hours. The Chainlink price prediction shows potential to exceed $20, while the LINK price might achieve $30 before Trump delivers his crypto summit speech, provided bulls maintain their momentum. Final Thought To sum up, the growth outlook for USA coins to buy appears strong, including the present Trump summit political event. Market development requires continuous investor observation to determine upcoming industry actions. The post 4 USA Coins to Buy Ahead of Trump’s Crypto Summit Speech appeared first on CoinGape .

Article 153: The Fed Blinked — The Bitcoin Bull Run Return Is Now Inevitable
Content:
On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve decided to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in the 4.25%–4.5% range – and Bitcoin reacted instantly. The pause, while widely anticipated, came with a slightly revised outlook that includes a slower timeline for future rate cuts and a notable adjustment to the central bank’s balance sheet reduction pace. According to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement, the Fed’s “Dot Plot” now indicates only two 25 basis-point rate cuts for this year—fewer than many market participants expected in December. Policymakers stressed that while interest rates remain in restrictive territory, the timing of actual cuts hinges on the path of economic indicators, particularly inflation and employment. However, the latest statement no longer asserts that inflation and employment are “in balance,” reflecting the Committee’s growing concern about economic uncertainty. But perhaps the most significant pivot was the Fed’s announcement that it will slow the reduction of its bond holdings, commonly known as “quantitative tightening” (QT). Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Are Back—Could This Be the Catalyst for the Next Rally? Beginning in April, the monthly runoff for government bonds will drop from $25 billion to $5 billion—a substantial downshift that many analysts consider a prelude to a more accommodative stance if economic or market conditions deteriorate. What This Means For Bitcoin Shortly after the Fed’s announcement, Bitcoin rallied roughly 4–5%, briefly surpassing the USD 86,000 level. Nik Bhatia—founder of The Bitcoin Layer and author of Bitcoin Age—took to his latest video update to dissect the decision’s implications. “Bitcoin up 4% on the news that the Fed slows QT and is still committed to cutting interest rates,” Bhatia said at the start of his analysis, noting that the market had been laser-focused on whether the central bank would modify its quantitative tightening approach. Bhatia explained how the reduction of the monthly runoff cap from $25 billion to $5 billion can loosen liquidity constraints in the overall system: “Now the Fed is also still contracting its balance sheet, but now it will do so by only five billion a month as opposed to 25 billion a month, and that is a material change,” he said. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Isn’t Over: Cathie Wood Predicts $1.5 Million “This isn’t some, ‘Hey, we’re on the cusp of QE now just ‘cause we went from 25 to a five,’ but the first step is to get the balance sheet to stop shrinking … so that if the Fed needs to pivot, it can go quickly from 5 billion in QT a month to some modest expansion.” Bhatia underscored that such a move can fuel market risk appetite: “The market sees the Fed for what it is: it supports credit creation which expands balance sheets across the world, and that flow ends up in asset prices … some of those assets can be stocks, Bitcoin—[and] other financial assets.” Other experts are even more drastic in their assessment. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes stated via X: “JAYPOW delivered, QT basically over Apr 1. The next thing we need to get bulled up for realz is either SLR exemption and or a restart of QE. Was BTC $77k the bottom, prob. But stonks prob have more pain left to fully convert Jay to team Trump so stay nimble and cashed up.” Jamie Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Realvision, pretty much agrees: “After last night, QT is effectively dead (for some time). Treasury volatility has backed right off and is now mirroring the decline in DXY from earlier this month. This is all extremely liquidity-positive.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $85,881.

Article 157: Anchorage Digital adds support for XION’s native token
Content:
XION ( XION ), a blockchain focused on bridging Web2 and Web3 , has announced that Anchorage Digital, the first and only federally chartered crypto bank, now supports its native token, as per the reports shared with Finbold on Thursday, March 20. Anchorage’s decision follows XION’s milestone of becoming the first Title II-compliant Layer-1 ( L1 ) blockchain and offers institutional asset holders a safe and regulated way to hold, stake, and trade XION. Institutional XION trading With XION integrated into Anchorage Digital, institutional investors can now seamlessly acquire, hold, and manage their assets without relying on traditional exchanges . The partnership thus simplifies institutional onboarding and ensures compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks, which helps promote blockchain technology as a legitimate tool in mainstream finance . Burnt Banksy, Founder of XION, discussed the potential of XION in institutional trading, stating: “Providing secure access to XION from a qualified custodian opens doors for asset managers, venture capital firms, and other institutional participants to engage with the ecosystem. With trusted platforms like Anchorage Digital, the gap between the legacy web and the next generation of blockchain applications is being narrowed.” XION’s blockchain infrastructure has already been adopted by a number of brands and projects, including Uber , Amazon Prime , BMW , Marvel Rivals , Lacoste, and The North Face. With its institutional-grade custody solutions, Anchorage Digital is therefore helping regulated, traditional financial (TradFi) entities to make initial moves in the Web3 space while maintaining compliance with industry standards. Staking XION Institutional investors can also stake XION through Anchorage Digital, contributing to network security and earning rewards within a compliant framework. Asset managers and venture firms seeking exposure to XION will likewise benefit from Anchorage Digital’s treasury management, staking , and liquidity solutions. By adopting XION and expanding its reach in a diverse range of industries, Anchorage Digital ensures it remains one of the key links between traditional and decentralized finance ( DeFi ).

Article 159: Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest in for 2025 Before the Bull Market Begins
Content:
The post Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest in for 2025 Before the Bull Market Begins appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the crypto market gears up for its next major rally, investors are looking for promising assets with strong growth potential. While well-established projects like Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX) continue expanding their ecosystems, newer tokens with built-in utility and structured growth models are capturing more attention. Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a standout investment, offering a combination of DeFi lending, an overcollateralized stablecoin, and a sustainable token economy that could drive significant price appreciation. Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX) Continue Strengthening Their Networks Cardano (ADA) has remained focused on blockchain scalability and smart contract enhancements, with ongoing developments aimed at increasing adoption. Its ecosystem continues to evolve, as projects building on the network explore new applications in decentralized finance and governance. With a research-driven approach, ADA’s long-term vision emphasizes security and efficiency, allowing the platform to gradually expand its capabilities. Tron (TRX) has maintained a strong presence in digital asset transactions, particularly in stablecoin settlements and decentralized applications. Its network processes a high volume of daily transactions, reflecting continued usage in the DeFi sector. Tron’s efficiency and cost-effectiveness make it a preferred choice for many blockchain-based financial activities, ensuring consistent engagement across its ecosystem. While both ADA and TRX remain active in the market, interest is shifting toward emerging projects like Mutuum Finance, where early adoption presents greater upside potential as the ecosystem expands. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Gaining Attention Unlike ADA and TRX, which rely on broad ecosystem adoption, Mutuum Finance is structured around a self-sustaining DeFi model, ensuring direct utility for its token. By enabling users to lend, borrow, and mint an overcollateralized stablecoin, MUTM creates an internal financial system that continuously drives demand. A key component of this ecosystem is Mutuum’s stablecoin, which is minted only when borrowers deposit excess collateral, ensuring it remains fully backed at all times. As borrowing increases, so does demand for both the stablecoin and MUTM, strengthening its role in the platform’s economic cycle. Unlike many DeFi models, where liquidity pools rely on external deposits, Mutuum Finance’s lending markets operate within a controlled, algorithmic framework, supporting smoother liquidity management and long-term stability. Mutuum Finance’s presale has drawn significant interest, with over 6,300 holders participating and more than $4 million raised. The token is currently priced at $0.02 in Phase 3, with an upcoming increase to $0.025, before reaching its official launch price of $0.06. With this structured pricing model, early investors securing their holdings now are set for guaranteed 3x returns at launch, as the listing price is set at $0.06. However, momentum suggests that MUTM could experience significant growth shortly after launch, driven by its expanding DeFi ecosystem and increasing demand for its lending and stablecoin services. As more users engage with the platform, the token’s market activity is expected to strengthen, reinforcing its long-term value potential. A significant feature of Mutuum Finance’s economic model is its buy-and-distribute mechanism, which plays a key role in sustaining long-term demand. A portion of the platform’s revenue is allocated to purchasing MUTM from the open market, reinforcing steady buy pressure. These acquired tokens are then redistributed to mtTOKEN holders, ensuring continued engagement from long-term investors. With borrowing, stablecoin transactions, and lending activity increasing over time, the volume of buybacks is expected to rise, further contributing to MUTM’s price appreciation and overall market strength. Which Crypto Holds the Strongest Potential for 2025? Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX) continue expanding their networks, offering scalability and financial applications across blockchain ecosystems. ADA’s focus on research-driven improvements ensures gradual network optimization, while TRX’s role in high-volume digital transactions supports its continued relevance in stablecoin settlements. However, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a high-growth investment, as its DeFi lending model, stablecoin integration, and structured buy-and-distribute mechanism ensure continuous demand for its token. With a rapidly growing presale, an operational platform launching alongside its token, and a structured ecosystem designed for long-term sustainability, MUTM stands out as a strong candidate for major price appreciation in 2025. As investors position themselves for the next crypto bull run, projects with real financial utility and long-term scalability are becoming the primary focus. ADA and TRX remain important players in the market, with ongoing developments aimed at strengthening their ecosystems. However, for those looking for early-stage opportunities with greater upside, Mutuum Finance presents a compelling case. With over $4 million raised, a growing investor base, and strong market momentum, MUTM is set to be one of the most promising crypto investments of 2025. As the presale advances, those securing their tokens now may be locking in one of the strongest investment opportunities before the bull market officially begins.

Article 161: Coinbase Sells 12,652 ETH in Q4 – Despite These Ethereum Price Jump By 7%
Content:
The post Coinbase Sells 12,652 ETH in Q4 – Despite These Ethereum Price Jump By 7% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Coinbase, one of the biggest crypto exchanges, reportedly sold 12,652 Ethereum (ETH) in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to Standard Chartered’s Geoffrey Kendrick. This sale, worth about $25 million at today’s prices, has sparked discussions on whether Coinbase is strategically selling ETH for profit rather than holding it long-term. Strategic Selling or Just Business Operations? Kendrick, who heads digital assets research at Standard Chartered, analyzed Coinbase’s quarterly reports . He found that the exchange holds ETH in different categories, including investment and operational funds. Interestingly, he noted that Coinbase tends to buy when ETH prices are low and sell when prices rise. In Q3, when ETH was around $2,500, the company was a net buyer. But in Q4, when ETH climbed to $4,000, Coinbase sold more than it bought. Kendrick believes this pattern shows Coinbase is acting like a “risk-adjusting profit maximizer.” Instead of accumulating ETH for the long haul, the exchange appears to be taking advantage of price swings to manage its financial strategy. Coinbase Responds to Claims In response, Coinbase acknowledged selling some ETH but emphasized that the funds were used for operational needs. A company spokesperson explained that Base, Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, earns ETH through sequencer fees. While most of this ETH is held for long-term investment, some are used for salaries, acquisitions, taxes, and grants. Coinbase also denied being a trading-focused entity, pointing out that its ETH holdings for investment grew by 20% in 2024. The exchange stressed that it does not actively trade crypto assets but may lend or stake them when necessary. Previous Accumulation Claims This isn’t the first time Coinbase has faced scrutiny over its ETH holdings. Just last month, a Base representative dismissed rumors about ETH sales, stating that Coinbase had accumulated over $300 million in ETH—more than double its earnings from Base. Ethereum Price Jump, But ETF Bleeds Ethereum is back on the rise, jumping over 7% and reclaiming the crucial $2,000 level. But despite this rally, the U.S. Ethereum spot ETF market is still bleeding cash. According to Farside, ETFs saw a massive $11.7 million outflow yesterday, extending the trend of investors pulling out. BlackRock’s ETHA led the losses, recording a staggering $12.9 million net outflow. Fidelity’s FETH wasn’t spared either, losing $2 million, while Grayscale Mini ETH saw another $7.7 million vanish.

Article 163: Lazarus Group sends $3.76m worth of Bitcoin to five unknown address
Content:
North Korean hacker group, Lazarus Group, was seen sending Bitcoin to multiple unknown addresses, bringing their total holdings down to 13,441 BTC, according to on-chain data. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, the North Korean hacker group’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings are now worth around $1.15 billion after the mass transfers. On March 20 at around 9:18 AM UTC, the wallet sent 12.929 BTC or equal to $1.12 million to an unknown wallet address. Following the 12.929 BTC transfer, the wallet continued to send Bitcoin to four other wallet addresses. Two unknown wallets each received 0.308 BTC, one wallet received around 14.849 BTC, another received 15.684 BTC. In total, the wallet sent out more than 44.07 BTC ($3.76 million) to five different wallet addresses in the past three hours. The fact that the Lazarus Group is distributing its BTC holdings across multiple wallets , the group may be doing so for laundering purposes to make the funds even more difficult to trace back. Earlier today, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou claimed that 88.87% of the stolen funds from the exchange is still traceable through on-chain data. According to Zhou, around 86.29% of the stolen funds — or equal to $1.23 billion — has been converted into 12,836 Bitcoin and spread across as many as 9,117 wallets. Zhou believes the hackers have been using Bitcoin mixers to scramble the transaction history, making the stolen funds even harder to track.

The Lazarus Group is a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, has been active since at least 2009. Their earliest known operation was called “Operation Troy,” which targeted the South Korean government. The group’s latest heist was a hack on the Bybit crypto exchange, which led to the platform losing around $1.4 billion. The hack is considered one of the largest crypto hacks ever recorded.

Article 164: Ripple: Free At Last, Will XRP Adoption Finally Take Off?
Content:
Summary XRP's regulatory clarity following the SEC case boosts its potential for institutional adoption and spot ETF approval, making it a compelling buy despite past reservations. Ripple CEO's announcement of the SEC case resolution led to a 12% XRP price jump, with further gains expected upon official SEC confirmation. The current market volatility and geopolitical tensions suggest a long-term holding strategy for XRP, as momentum trading is riskier now. The approval of XRP spot ETFs could dilute inflows for BTC and ETFs, but aligns with the increasing institutional interest and regulatory support for crypto assets. It's been exactly three months since I last wrote on Ripple ( XRP-USD ) here on Seeking Alpha. My last coverage heavily leaned on the RLUSD stablecoin and the opportunities it presents for the Ripple ecosystem, and the on-chain liquidity and use case it potentially creates for the XRP Ledger. In that piece, I hinted at XRP not being one of my favorite cryptos to hold in the current crypto market cycle. Here’s my reason in the excerpt from that article below: XRP isn't one of my favorite altcoins at the moment because I think it won't be among the most rewarding crypto assets in this bull season of the market cycle. XRP has had impressive runs in the last two bull markets, especially during the 2017 crypto bull market. However, in the spirit of the current crypto bull market, I'm upgrading my rating for XRP to a “buy” despite my reservations about XRP giving impressive gains moving forward. Excerpt from previous XRP coverage Prior to that article, XRP had rallied for months after a federal judge gave Ripple a slap-on-the-wrist fine of $125 million (compared to the over $2 billion fine the SEC was pushing for), with an injunction order against securities laws violation in the future. The SEC had tried to appeal the ruling. Additionally, President Trump’s pre- and post-election “Trump effect” on the crypto market was still in full swing at that time. And following that article, XRP (as well as much of the crypto market) rallied further, until halted by the steep market correction we’ve seen recently due to geopolitics - mainly tariff wars - which has also affected the broader equity market. XRP has built a die-hard following over the years that the power of its community has enabled XRP to become one of the cryptocurrencies that's hard to ignore. XRP makes the news one way or the other. Over the years, the SEC’s years-long case with XRP garnered much attention that the SEC vs XRP case was thought of as the litmus test for how crypto issuers launch and distribute crypto tokens. Today, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced on X that the SEC vs Ripple four-year-long legal brawl was finally over. Brad’s announcement is technically unofficial as the SEC is yet to make an official declaration, and according to Brad, the SEC would drop its appeal on the ruling made by the federal judge in August last year. XRP price action following Brad Garlinghouse's announcement (Seeking Alpha) The “unofficial” announcement from the CEO saw XRP jump ~12% from the daily open price of $2.28, to reach a daily high of $2.59. XRP closed March 19 at $2.55. I think in the coming weeks, when the SEC formalizes its decision, and the SEC makes the official announcement, XRP price could gain further on the news if momentum returns to crypto in general. The SEC case with Ripple was not a nothingburger for Ripple, and it has limited XRP adoption over the years. Though Ripple Labs focuses on building tech that is institution-grade out of the box, XRP was largely shunned by institutions due to the risk of enforcement actions. Now that the case is coming to a close and the regulatory classification of XRP is clearly defined, XRP and Ripple products are bound to see broader adoption, especially by institutions. An XRP ETF, Anyone? Crypto spot ETFs are becoming mainstream and a slew of approval for major crypto assets are likely to happen in the future, with the current U.S. government friendly stance toward crypto. I'm viewing the spot ETFs like the early days of crypto tokens after ICO launches on Ethereum made them possible. The early crypto tokens had the advantage of garnering enough liquidity. Launching of crypto tokens is effortless these days, and hundreds (if not thousands) of tokens (mostly meme coins) are launched daily; therefore, there is thinner liquidity spread among altcoins. We’ve seen how the “alt season” has been delayed in this market cycle, and utility tokens have had to grapple with fragmented liquidity. I foresee a similar trend with crypto spot ETFs. For now, only Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) spot ETFs have been approved in the U.S., and they enjoy all the demand and inflows into spot ETFs. In the event that the floodgates to approvals open a bit more, and more spot ETFs see approval, there will likely be diluted liquidity distribution among these ETFs, which will impact their demand ratio, in my view. Spot ETF proposals have already been filed for Solana ( SOL-USD ), Cardano ( ADA-USD ), Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ), as well as XRP. Following today's announcement, Brad stated emphatically in a Bloomberg interview that XRP will be added to the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, and he is confident that XRP spot ETFs will come before the year ends. As for XRP’s inclusion in the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, that's out of the scope of my investment thesis. The likelihood of seeing XRP spot ETFs this year aligns with my analysis, and I lean towards agreeing with him. XRP’s regulatory definition is coming at a timely moment when it is likely that the XRP spot ETF will be the next to see approval. Ripple CEO has been one of the crypto execs lobbying the White House for clearer policies that will favor the industry since President Trump assumed office. He was present at the first-ever White House Crypto Summit, and it is rumored that among the crypto execs lobbying the White House, Brad is one of the favorite candidates to likely be on the White House Crypto Advisory Council . The CEO’s engagements with the White House brings Ripple a step closer to having a main seat at the policymaking table. This bodes well for Ripple Labs as a company and is bullish for XRP. Risks and Takeaway The last weeks have been highly volatile for crypto assets. President Trump's positive stance towards crypto has been overshadowed by his own macro policies, particularly the tariffs. Technical charts are uncertain at the moment, and the uncertainty and doubt is heightened throughout the market. XRP’s new regulatory clarity is the type of news that should typically create sustained momentum for the crypto asset; however, in the current FUD-filled clime of the market, gains have been short-lived. I think it’s best to have a longer-term view if you plan to hold crypto assets, including XRP. Momentum trading is currently riskier. Regulatory clarity for XRP means potential spot XRP ETFs approval, and it opens doors to more institutional partnerships for Ripple. If the crypto market still has momentum left in this cycle, I expect XRP to deliver at least modest returns from here, now that the shackles are finally off.

Article 166: Crypto companies strive to obtain banking licenses. Exploring the growing intersection of banks and crypto platforms
Content:
On Mar. 18, 2025, Reuters reported that various crypto companies seek to become state or national banks, which they see as an avenue for expanding their businesses under the Trump Administration. What can change for crypto companies once they become banks? Don’t they already serve as banks? Aren’t banks increasingly embracing crypto? Multi-faceted crypto platforms and banks have had overlapping functionality as many people can store their savings via crypto, grow capital using yield mining or staking, or get crypto loans. In regions with a high unbanked population that has smartphones, crypto platforms already occupy a bank-like position. However, getting licensed as a state or national bank is different from just being a defacto bank-like entity. Let’s see what the prospects are for the crypto platforms seeking to become full-fledged banks. As the U.S. took a pro-crypto course, these companies have a bigger chance of transforming into banks. The modern-day regulators don’t see crypto as something utterly inadmissible. Reuters cites lawyers admitting that there is a rising interest from crypto companies that are cautiously seeking new opportunities. Read more: Trump-era policy shift sparks crypto firms’ push for banking licenses: report SmartBiz acquired Centrust Bank, becoming the first fintech company to get a bank charter since 2021, indicating a possible trend setting. Earlier this month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reversed the banks’ anti-crypto stance, permitting banks to engage in cryptocurrency-related activity, including stablecoins operations, crypto custody, etc. Why do some crypto platforms want to transform into banks? First off, the companies hope to obtain bank status to boost their credibility. It may attract new individual and corporate clients, as banks seem more trustworthy and familiar to them than cryptocurrency ecosystems. It opens new opportunities and allows companies to scale up substantially. Bank charter is associated with additional scrutiny, but on the other hand, it gives companies a more legitimate image that is important for business expansion. The second reason is that bank regulations pull crypto out of the grey zone, giving the companies a clearer legislative environment, thus providing a more predictable development trajectory and the opportunity to follow their strategies more confidently. Another benefit of getting a bank charter is direct access to clients’ deposits. Without it, crypto companies have to borrow funds and pay high fees. With clients’ deposits, companies may be less constrained in their actions and development. An intersection of banks and crypto platforms Although blockchain has literally been antagonistic towards banks from day one (remember the message attached to the genesis block of Bitcoin), both banks and cryptocurrency businesses managed to co-exist and shape each other’s ways of operation. It seems that crypto no longer poses an existential threat to banks. Banks were adopting blockchain solutions, while crypto platforms adopted many of banks’ services, like loans and more basic operations like remittance. Traditional banks use blockchain solutions for various reasons. Distributed ledger and smart contracts infrastructure allow banks to automate some processes and reduce costs, elevate compliance and overall security of funds and data, and increase settlement speed, especially when it comes to cross-border transactions. It’s worth saying that not only does automation make the services cheaper, but it also eliminates human errors and prevents fraudulent activity. Such companies as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs use blockchain to streamline the Know Your Customer verification process. An international consortium of banks, Fnality International (it includes Barclays plc, HSBC Holdings, and other major banks), uses blockchain for cross-border transactions. These are only a few examples of many. CBDCs will reduce the intermediary engagement between citizens and central banks while not stopping commercial banks from providing services like crediting and others. At the same time, cryptocurrency platforms were serving as banks in the rural unbanked areas with high mobile Internet penetration. Such areas can be found in Sub-Saharan Africa and some of the Asian regions. The residents of these areas mostly use crypto for remittance and savings. The early 2020s saw the rise of neobanks, digital-first online banks that offer traditional banking services. The customer-centric approach and use of peer-to-peer solutions gave neobanks advantages over traditional banks. They charge lower fees, provide user-friendly apps, and usually have a more favorable approach to providing credits/loans to clients. Most popular digital banks like Chime or Revolut account for tens of millions of clients. According to Plaid, over 21% of people aged between 21 and 56 were using neobanks as their primary checking account. The adoption of cryptocurrencies was a logical step in the development of some of the neobanks. Revolut is a notable example of a neobank supporting cryptocurrency operations on top of other features like stock trading, currency exchange, and virtual cards. We will likely see more crypto companies becoming banks in the future, as both the U.S. regulators and businesses express interest in such a development. Soon, we will learn if other countries are taking notes. You might also like: Neobanks are bridging financial gaps with blockchain | Opinion

In a recent X post, expert Gert van Lagen made a bold prediction for XRP price, forecasting a parabolic continuation of its bull market. According to van Lagen’s analysis, Ripple’s native asset is poised to bounce off the neckline of a 7-year-old Double Bottom/Ascending Triangle pattern. According to his analysis, XRP is targeting a minimum of $38 based on historical trends. The last breakout of lesser magnitude resulted in the price doubling its parabolic target, indicating a potentially conservative estimate.

Article 169: Majority of EU crypto payments spent on retail, food, and beverages: Report
Content:
Retail transactions, food, and drinks make up most cryptocurrency usage behaviors in the European Union, a new mini-report by Oobit indicates. The study conducted an investigation of six months of Oobit usage data. The statistics show that 70% of all crypto costs are categorized as day-to-day retail purchases. Romania, Poland, and Hungary were also the top three nations for crypto payment usage on the Oobit platform. USDT is the leading choice of payment currency Tether’s USDT has become the go-to stablecoin for European crypto payments. USDT made up 92% of all transactions that were made via the Oobit app. The transaction records reveal fascinating trends in the manner in which people use the platform. The overall average payment amount for all the nations covered in the report was quite small at $8.36. This indicates that users are mostly making use of crypto for small, routine purchases as opposed to significant expenses. As opposed to that, the average deposit amount was much larger at $85. This implies that users tend to top up their accounts with significant amounts that get spent over numerous small transactions. Outside of retail, food, and drinks (which comprised 70% of expenditure), the second-biggest category for crypto transactions comprised 26% of expenses. It consists of accommodation, travel, and aviation services. Government services and digital payments comprise only 1.5% of expenditure, with another 1.5% comprising miscellaneous services such as healthcare and entertainment. The top five countries in crypto payment adoption via Oobit were Lithuania, Spain, Hungary, Poland, and Romania. Although average payment sizes were fairly uniform among these markets (from $7.1 in Romania to $9.3 in Spain), deposit sizes varied more. The standout was Lithuania, with an average deposit of $169. That is considerably higher than Romania’s $37 average. Country-specific trends reveal regulatory impact The top three nations for crypto payment adoption via Oobit were Romania, Poland, and Hungary. All three have one thing in common: they are building crypto-friendly regulatory environments. This indicates that government policy is a driving force behind consumer adoption of digital asset payments. Romania had the highest number of active users, although it had the lowest average payment size at $7.1 and the lowest average deposit at $37. The nation’s new tax policy could be the reason for this increase. Romania recently implemented a tax break amendment to its fiscal code that excludes income from crypto investments by natural persons until July 31, 2025. As per the report, the move is meant to “improve transparency in crypto transactions as well as allow for the mapping of this new market into the Romanian economy.” Similar to other leading markets, Romanian consumers mostly spent on food, retail, and beverages, with 71% of the transactions in this category. Poland was in second place when it comes to usage statistics for Oobit, with average payment sizes of $8.3 and average deposits of $49. The report also mentions that crypto has entered mainstream political debate in Poland. Poland has already had a regulatory framework set in place that permits crypto firms like exchanges to operate legally, laying the groundwork for consumer adoption. Hungary trailed closely with an average payment amount of $7.9 and average deposits of $41. The nation has made tangible strides toward end-to-end crypto regulation. Its Ministry for National Economy introduced a draft law that would enable domestic banks to provide digital assets directly to customers under the oversight of the Hungarian National Bank. Hungary’s parliament also passed Act VII of 2024 on Markets in Crypto-Assets , which took effect in June 2024. Lithuania stands out for high-value engagement Lithuania is one of the top five crypto payment markets in Europe. The users in this region have also shown higher deposit values despite similar transaction patterns. With an average deposit of $169, Lithuanian users appear to fund their crypto payment accounts more substantially while maintaining average transaction sizes comparable to other markets at $8.1. The report attributes this outlier status to Lithuania’s position as “an established crypto business hub with low corporate taxes and a clear regulatory framework.” Lithuanian users showed the strongest concentration in retail spending among all top markets. This represents a notably higher percentage than the overall average of 70% across all markets. This suggests Lithuanian crypto payment adopters may be more focused on using digital assets specifically for daily shopping needs. Spain, ranking fourth in usage, recorded the highest average payment size at $9.3 with deposits averaging $77. However, Spanish users showed the most diverse spending pattern among the top five countries. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025. Learn More

Companies that have been mistakenly included in the tracker can contact the DFPI at ask.dfpi@dfpi.ca.gov for assistance. Did you know? In 2024, the DFPI received more than 2,668 complaints from investors in California and across the US. Based on these complaints, in partnership with the California Department of Justice, it shut down more than 26 different crypto scam websites and unraveled $4.6 million in consumer losses. How to use California’s crypto scam tracker tool California’s scam tracker tool is invaluable for identifying patterns in scammer behavior and helping investors avoid similar scams. Additionally, it encourages investors to report scams, contributing to the safety of the community. The tracker can be broadly used in three ways: For due diligence: You can search for specific companies or websites using the tool to uncover existing complaints. This feature helps you gain insights into others’ experiences with similar offers, allowing for a preliminary risk assessment. However, it’s important to note that the absence of complaints doesn’t guarantee legitimacy, as scam sites often rebrand or operate under different names. For analysis of messaging: The scam tracker enables you to analyze suspicious messaging by searching relevant keywords. You could use terms like “lending” or “insurance” to discover patterns and similarities between the offers you have received and past complaints. This comparative approach helps you identify potential red flags and recognize the tactics of the scamsters. For education and prevention: The tracker’s glossary serves as an educational resource, outlining various terms used in crypto scams. By familiarizing yourself with these tactics, you can significantly enhance your awareness and protect yourself from falling victim to fraudulent schemes. This proactive approach to education is essential in navigating the complex and often risky cryptocurrency market. Did you know? The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) 2023 Cryptocurrency Fraud Report shows California faced the highest crypto-related losses in the US, reaching $1.15 billion. Within the FBI San Francisco Field Office’s jurisdiction, losses totaled $260,313,902, affecting 1,226 victims across 15 counties, including Alameda, San Francisco and Santa Clara. How does California’s scam crypto tracker tool work? The tracker compiles scams reported directly by consumers. The entries detail descriptions of losses to the complainants. To view the information shared with the DFPI, you may use the search function to explore complaints by company, scam type or keywords. For instance, if you search using the keyword “trading platforms,” the tracker lists scams associated with the keyword. The tracker is segregated into five columns, comprising primary subject, complaint narrative, scam type, website and screenshot. To change the order of the list, you can click the arrow beside the column header. You can also determine the number of entries you want to see at the time. To select the number of entries on a page, click the dropdown box at the bottom of the list and select your chosen number. To toggle between the pages displaying the entries, you can use the buttons “Previous” and “Next.” Fraudulent schemes listed by California’s crypto scam tracker tool The crypto scam tracker exposes many fraudulent schemes plaguing the crypto space. From fake job offers to pig butchering scams , the tracker sheds light on the tactics used to deceive investors. Here are some examples of scams listed in the glossary section of the tracker tool. Pig butchering scam: A pig butchering scam involves fraudsters building trust with you through social, romantic or business interactions before luring you into a fake investment scheme and persuading you to transfer funds to a fraudulent platform. These platforms might even display fake profits to encourage further deposits. Victims are denied withdrawal of funds on various pretexts, and scammers eventually disappear with the money. Rug pull scams: These schemes involve developers who intentionally attract investors with false promises of high returns only to disappear with the money later. They often create a buzz on social media by roping in celebrities, which shoots up the cost of the tokens . Then the developers sell off their tokens to make big profits and crash the price, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Did you know? A single X post by Argentine President Javier Milei, promoting the LIBRA token , caused its market capitalization to surge to $4 billion. However, the subsequent deletion of the post within hours led to a rapid crash, resulting in substantial losses for investors. Crypto job scams: Fraudsters pose as recruiters, luring victims with fabricated job offers to steal cryptocurrency and sensitive data. These positions usually offer easy money in return for “jobs” that don’t require any specific expertise. For instance, the fraudster may be offering 100 US dollars for watching an hour of advertisements. These scams are designed to trick individuals into depositing crypto with fraudsters and getting access to critical information such as passwords to their wallets . Wallet drainer scams: Crypto drainers are designed to steal your digital assets by transferring them to a scammer’s wallet. These schemes tend to use social engineering, where fraudsters build trust with you through deceptive emails, calls and fabricated documents. They create fake crypto websites, enticing you with promises of airdrops or non-fungible token (NFT) minting . You end up approving transactions, believing you are signing legitimate contracts or claiming rewards, only to have your wallet emptied. Fraudulent trading platform: The scammer creates a deceptive website or application, persuading victims to deposit funds by presenting it as an exclusive investment opportunity. These fraudulent platforms are designed to look authentic, often mimicking actual price movements and generating fake profits to appear legitimate. Imposter scams: Imposter scams involve fraudsters posing as trusted figures, such as company executives, support staff or government officials, to deceive victims into sending funds or sharing sensitive information. These scammers often use fake websites, social media accounts or phishing emails to appear credible. Bitcoin mining scams: Bitcoin mining scams lure investors with fake opportunities to fund mining operations. Scammers claim invested capital will build the necessary infrastructure, like GPUs and servers, promising a share of the mined Bitcoin ( BTC ) as returns. But these investments are fraudulent, and the promised infrastructure rarely, if ever, exists. Steps taken by other US agencies and states to raise crypto scam awareness Protecting crypto investors from these fraudulent practices requires a robust and multifaceted approach. US federal and state regulators are collaborating to educate investors about emerging scam patterns and compile a comprehensive defense against fraudsters. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) protects consumers from scams. Users can report fraudulent activities on the FTC website and also find information on different types of scams. The FTC also manages the National Do Not Call Registry, which helps consumers block unwanted calls. Another key agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), plays an active role in regulating crypto assets. It issues fraud warnings, investigates companies, and reviews consumer complaints. Several US states have also taken initiatives to combat scams: New York: The New York Attorney General’s Office runs the Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau, which investigates scams and offers tips to help consumers stay safe. Massachusetts: The Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office uses advanced tools like the TRM Labs blockchain intelligence platform to trace stolen funds and fight crypto-related scams. Texas: The Texas Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division assists scam victims and guides them to avoid fraud. Florida: The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services maintains a Consumer Protection webpage with scam prevention tips and a complaint submission option. The US follows a multi-layered approach to crypto scam prevention and consumer protection. Federal agencies like the FTC and CFPB provide nationwide oversight and resources regarding the crypto space, while state-level initiatives offer localized support and specialized tools. This collaborative effort, combining education with enforcement, underscores the importance of vigilance and proactive measures in dealing with the complex landscape of scams. However, due to the fragmented crypto crime reporting system in the US, industry leaders advocate for a unified platform that consolidates data and allows victims to track complaints. While still in development, understanding this need helps set realistic expectations and supports ongoing reform efforts. As more stakeholders push for standardized measures, such a platform could significantly improve transparency, support victims, and foster stronger accountability within the crypto space.

Article 173: Trump Media Executives Seek to Raise $179M Through SPAC, Possibly to Buy US Crypto Company
Content:
Former and current Trump Media & Technology Group executives are launching a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). They are looking to raise $179 million to buy a US-based crypto firm, possibly, according to Forbes reports. Three former and current Trump Media & Technology Group executives are launching a company that may purchase a US-based cryptocurrency or blockchain firm. Trump Administration Backs Crypto and Blockchain Sector Three senior executives at Trump Media & Technology Group have launched Renatus Tactical Acquisition Corp I, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), aiming to raise $179 million through public and private offering, Forbes reports. Citing an SEC registration statement filed on March 14, the media giant reports the SPAC aims to acquire a crypto or blockchain-related company amid the Trump administration’s backing of the sector. Renatus Tactical Acquisition Corp I, a SPAC incorporated in the Cayman Islands, seeks to raise at least $179 million, which it will use to acquire another company. Per the SEC filing, Renatus is focused on acquisitions in the crypto, blockchain, data security and dual-use technology sectors. The registration statement notes these industries have heavy government involvement as regulators or major clients. The firm’s leadership enjoys strong ties with the President’s media company. Forbes notes Renatus’ CEO, Eric Swider, is a Trump Media board member, while Devin Nunes, the president and chair of Trump Media, chairs Renatus’ board. Alexander Cano, Renatus Tactical’s COO, was president and secretary of Digital World, the firm that merged with Trump Media. Details: Focus on the Crypto and Blockchain Sector As previously noted, Renatus Tactical plans to use the funds raised to pursue acquisitions in the cryptocurrency, blockchain, data security and dual-use technologies markets. In its SEC filing, Renatus Tactical explained its focus, stating: “The current administration has taken unprecedented steps to integrate digital assets into the national financial strategy.” While the company is interested in the abovementioned industries, it may pursue acquisitions in any industry. Renatus Tactical aims to raise a substantial sum of $178,942,500 through an initial public offering and private placement. According to the filing, the company will sell 17.5 million shares to the public at $10 a share and 3,942,500 warrants at $1 each via a private placement. Trump’s Pro-Crypto Plans President Donald Trump won favour during the election for his intended pro-crypto policies. After years of intense crackdown on the industry, President Trump argued that continued siege would likely drive the sector off US shores, stating that under his administration, that would change. In his less than three months in office, Trump has made strides in promoting the industry, introducing a strategic Bitcoin reserve plan and signing an executive order instructing the establishment of a national digital asset stockpile. President Trump highlighted his commitment to advancing crypto legislation during the administration's first Crypto Summit . The commander-in-chief urged Congress to pass legislation before August, stating: “I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet, and we’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise.” President Trump’s pro-crypto policies have been met with enthusiasm, adding to his increasing approval from the public.

Article 176: Qubetics’ 15.2M Presale, AAVE’s Power and Stacks’ Evolution—Why These Are the Top Cryptos to Invest in This Week!
Content:
Crypto moves fast. One day, a project is under the radar; the next, it’s skyrocketing to new heights. Just look at the top cryptos to invest in this week —some are breaking out, while others are preparing for massive upgrades that could reshape their ecosystems. If you’re not paying attention, you could miss the next big thing. That’s exactly why Qubetics ($TICS) is dominating conversations right now. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it’s revolutionizing blockchain interoperability with QubeQode IDE, an all-in-one development tool that simplifies cross-chain programming. Meanwhile, AAVE is taking DeFi mainstream with an exclusive Oxford meetup, and Stacks is making headlines with its Pectra upgrade. If you’re looking for the best crypto opportunities this week, you might want to stick around. Qubetics – The Future of Web3 Interoperability is Here Qubetics is shaking up the crypto space by solving a problem that’s been holding blockchain back—interoperability. Right now, developers are stuck dealing with siloed chains, complex coding environments, and inefficient cross-chain transactions. Qubetics fixes all of this with QubeQode IDE, a first-of-its-kind blockchain development suite designed to unify Web3 networks. Imagine a world where Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Polkadot all communicate effortlessly. That’s exactly what Qubetics is building. The QubeQode IDE provides a seamless environment for developers to write smart contracts across multiple chains without needing to learn different programming languages. This is a game-changer for both businesses and individual users, making it easier to launch dApps, bridge assets, and scale blockchain-based operations. For real-world applications, this is huge. Enterprises looking to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) can now integrate with multiple blockchains without excessive development costs. Cross-border payments become instant and gas-efficient. NFT marketplaces gain fluid interoperability between Ethereum, Solana, and beyond. With Qubetics’ multi-chain smart contract execution, Web3 is about to become a whole lot smarter. Qubetics Presale – The Clock is Ticking on Early Access If you’re looking for the top cryptos to invest in this week, Qubetics’ presale might be your golden ticket. This isn’t just another crypto token—$TICS is the backbone of the Web3 interoperability revolution. Right now, Qubetics is in Stage 26 of its presale, with each token priced at $0.1181. Over $15.2 million has been raised, with 501 million $TICS tokens already sold and 23,400 token holders. Each presale stage lasts only 7 days, and once it ends, there’s an automatic 10% price increase—meaning if you wait, you’ll be paying more. The numbers don’t lie. If you had bought in earlier, you’d already be sitting on triple-digit returns. But even at its current price, the upside is massive. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $1 post-presale, delivering a 746.05% ROI. And if the token reaches $10 after its mainnet launch in Q2 2025, that’s an 8,360.47% gain. AAVE – Expanding DeFi Adoption with a Major Oxford Meetup AAVE has been a DeFi powerhouse for years, but it’s now making moves that could bring billions of dollars into decentralized finance. The latest? An exclusive Oxford meetup on March 18 that’s expected to attract top fintech leaders, blockchain developers, and institutional players. Why does this matter? AAVE has been one of the most influential DeFi platforms, offering lending, borrowing, and staking solutions across multiple chains. The upcoming event at Oxford will focus on scaling DeFi for real-world financial applications, including tokenized assets, regulatory frameworks, and AI-driven risk management. With over $6 billion locked in AAVE’s ecosystem, it remains a dominant force in the DeFi space. But this Oxford event could push it even further, setting the stage for institutional adoption of DeFi protocols. If you’re bullish on the future of decentralized finance, AAVE’s next move is worth watching. Stacks – The Layer-2 Network That’s Changing the Bitcoin Game Bitcoin’s biggest challenge has always been scalability. But Stacks is rewriting the rules with its Pectra upgrade, a major milestone that’s set to transform Bitcoin’s Layer-2 landscape. Stacks has been a game-changer, allowing Bitcoin to support smart contracts and DeFi applications. But with Pectra, the network is taking things to the next level by improving security, transaction speed, and compatibility with the broader crypto ecosystem. According to industry reports, Layer-2 networks are consolidating, and Stacks is emerging as one of the leading platforms. The Pectra upgrade will enhance Bitcoin’s usability, enabling developers to build faster, more efficient dApps on top of the original blockchain. For Bitcoin maximalists who believe in on-chain solutions, Stacks is positioning itself as the future of Bitcoin-based DeFi. Conclusion: The Market is Changing – Are You In? If you’re looking for the top cryptos to invest in this week, the choices are clear. Qubetics is revolutionizing blockchain interoperability, AAVE is expanding DeFi to institutional players, and Stacks is supercharging Bitcoin’s capabilities. The key takeaway? Timing is everything. Qubetics’ crypto presale is surging, and every new stage means a higher price floor. AAVE’s Oxford meetup could trigger a DeFi boom, and Stacks’ Pectra upgrade is making Bitcoin smarter than ever.

Article 177: Arizona Leads Bitcoin Reserve Race As Two Bills Pass House Commerce Committee Vote
Content:
Arizona has taken the lead in the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) race after two bills passed the House of Representatives Commerce Committee vote on March 18. The state now has two active crypto reserve legislations and a legal tender bill, which have also advanced to the next stage. House Commerce Committee Passes Bitcoin Reserve Bills On Tuesday, the Arizona House Commerce Committee met to consider three Bitcoin-related legislations, including two strategic reserve bills, which passed the vote to advance to the next legislative stage. Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025), also known as the “Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act,” passed the vote with a 6 – 4 majority. Bitcoin Laws noted that the vote “was along partisan lines: Republicans for; Democrats against.” If passed, the legislation, sponsored by Republican Senator Wendy Rogers, would allow public funds in Arizona, such as the state treasurer or state retirement system, to invest up to 10% of their assets under management in cryptocurrencies, focusing on Bitcoin (BTC). “If the United States Secretary of the Treasury establishes a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the storage of government Bitcoin holdings, a public fund may store the virtual currency holdings of the public fund in a secure segregated account within the strategic Bitcoin reserve,” SB1025 reads. The bill also provides a framework for public funds to diversify their investments and establishes clear guidelines and definitions to manage them. Meanwhile, Senate Bill 1373 (SB1373), sponsored by Republican Senator Mark Finchem, passed with a 6 – 4 vote on Tuesday. The legislation aims to establish a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund in the state, comprised of seized cryptocurrencies and appropriated legislative funds that can be held through secure custody solutions or exchange-traded products (ETPs). The fund would be managed by the state treasurer, who could invest up to 10% of its total deposit in any fiscal year and may loan its assets to generate additional returns if it doesn’t increase the state’s financial risks. “The bill also outlines strict requirements for secure custody solutions, including exclusive key access, encrypted environments, hardware maintenance in multiple secure data centers, multi-party governance, comprehensive logging, regular security audits, and disaster recovery protocols,” Bitcoin Laws explains. Arizona Takes The SBR Lead After Utah scrapped its BTC reserve clause, Arizona became the state with the most advanced SBR legislation. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Utah State Senate exited the SBR race this month after amending the proposed bill allowing the state treasury to invest in digital assets. Following this development, Arizona took the lead with two reserve bills awaiting a final floor vote in the Senate before moving to the House Commerce Committee. Both strategic reserve bills now move to the House Rules Committee, which has a 5 – 3 Republican majority. If they pass the Rules Committee vote, SB1015 and SB1373 will only require a vote by the full House before heading to the governor’s desk. Similarly, another BTC-related bill passed the House Commerce Committee on Tuesday with a 6-4 vote and heads to the next stage. Senate Bill 1062 (SB1062), also sponsored by Senator Mark Finchem, aims to expand the state’s definition of legal tender to include cryptocurrencies, including BTC, alongside traditional currencies. The legislation also updates different sections of Arizona’s tax code to include the new legal tender definition and ensure consistency across different statutes, suggesting an effort to recognize the industry as a key sector.

It reveals that Binance’s Solana holdings have surged by 37% within one month from 16M SOL to the current balance of 22M SOL. Binance’s Solana holdings are now at their highest level since November 2024. Binance Solana Holdings On-chain analytics platform Glassnode also revealed that the recent decline in Solana price drove accumulation. It noted that after the price fell to $123 last week, traders bought 16.2M SOL . They also purchased 19M SOL at $126. This accumulation could offer support for SOL price between $123 and $126, preventing a prolonged downtrend. If this level holds, it will support a bullish Solana price forecast past $300. Can Solana Reach $300? Solana price today trades at $131 with a slight 1.5% gain in 24 hours. The altcoin has formed an ascending triangle pattern on its daily chart according to analyst Nebraskangooner. If the ongoing accumulation trend by Binance and long-term holders continues, SOL could break out from the upper trendline, which is also the 20-day EMA. If SOL overcomes the strong resistance at $137, it could continue with the uptrend toward the 50-day EMA at $158. However, a strong move to $300 will be confirmed if Solana price flips the 200-day EMA. The MACD indicator is also showing signs of more Solana price gains . The histogram bars are green, indicating an increase in buying activity. However, the bullish momentum is weak because the MACD remains negative. A strong uptrend will happen if this line crosses above the zero line. SOL/USD: 1-day Chart Besides the bullish technical outlook, today’s launch of the first SOL Futures ETF by Volatility Shares could also spark a bull run. Additionally, network activity on the Solana blockchain is rising again. Data from DappRadar shows that in the last 24 hours, dApp volumes on the network surged by more than 300% from $78M to $190M. The total transactions have also risen to 19.3M, which is the highest in more than a week. Solana dApp Volumes High network activity has always been a bullish catalyst for Solana price. If this continues as traders buy the dip, SOL can attain the $300 price target soon. The post How Binance Could Fuel Next Solana Price Rally to $300 appeared first on CoinGape .
Article 180: Bitcoin Options Soar After FED Meeting! What's the Latest on Ethereum Options? Here Are the Details
Content:
Bitcoin (BTC) investors are increasingly betting on price gains via options markets following the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting, while Ethereum (ETH) continues to see cautious sentiment reflecting ongoing uncertainty despite the upcoming network upgrade. BTC Options Rise After Fed Meeting The shift in sentiment came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reaffirmed the central bank's forecast of two rate cuts this year and downplayed the inflationary impact of tariffs implemented under the Trump administration, calling them “temporary.” Data from Amberdata shows that Bitcoin’s risk returns have turned positive, meaning traders are now paying a premium for call options (bullish bets) over put options (bearish bets). This marks a significant reversal from previous weeks, when downside fears fueled demand for protective put options. According to Paradigm, an institutional over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform, options flows have seen an increase in demand for call options on March 21 and March 28, while put options were sold off, suggesting that investors are positioning for a potential BTC rally in the coming weeks. The shift in the options market coincides with broader optimism for regulatory clarity in the crypto industry following the conclusion of the SEC’s legal battle with Ripple, which could have positive implications. Ethereum Options Lag as Investors Remain Cautious Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum’s options market continues to reflect a bias toward downside protection and still commands a premium over calls, particularly for contracts expiring in May. Despite the upcoming Ethereum Pectra update that is expected to increase network efficiency and scalability, traders remain hesitant. The update, which will introduce smart accounts, blob scaling, and validator improvements, is set to go live on March 26, but Ethereum has yet to see any notable changes in sentiment. *This is not investment advice.

Article 183: Urgent Crypto Alert: Lazarus Group’s Massive Bitcoin Conversion Exposes $1.4B Theft
Content:
Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The digital underworld has been buzzing with a revelation that sounds straight out of a spy thriller. Bybit exchange CEO, Ben Zhou, dropped a bombshell on X, exposing the audacious tactics of the notorious North Korean Lazarus Group. These cyber masterminds, linked to a staggering $1.4 billion cryptocurrency heist, have reportedly converted a whopping 86.29% of their ill-gotten gains into Bitcoin. Let’s dive deep into this unfolding saga and understand the implications for the crypto world. Unmasking the Lazarus Group’s Bitcoin Strategy Imagine this: a shadowy organization, suspected to be North Korea’s Lazarus Group, pilfering a colossal sum of cryptocurrency and then expertly maneuvering it through the intricate web of the blockchain. According to Bybit CEO Ben Zhou’s report, this is precisely what has transpired. Out of the 440,091 ETH stolen, a staggering 86.29% has been transformed into 12,836 BTC. This conversion, spread across a staggering 9,117 different wallets, paints a picture of a highly organized and sophisticated operation. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key figures: Total Stolen Funds (Initially in ETH): 440,091 ETH Percentage Converted to Bitcoin: 86.29% Bitcoin Acquired: 12,836 BTC Wallets Involved: 9,117 This data underscores the sheer scale and meticulous planning behind this cryptocurrency theft . The Lazarus Group’s ability to convert such a massive amount of Ethereum into Bitcoin without triggering immediate alarms speaks volumes about their operational prowess and the challenges faced in tracking and recovering stolen crypto assets. Why Bitcoin? The Preferred Choice for Cybercriminals? Why did the Lazarus Group choose Bitcoin as their primary conversion target? Several factors could be at play: Liquidity and Acceptance: Bitcoin is the most liquid and widely accepted cryptocurrency globally. Its robust trading volume across numerous exchanges makes it easier to move large sums without significantly impacting the market. Established Infrastructure: Bitcoin’s mature infrastructure and longer history provide a more established and perhaps perceived as less traceable network compared to newer or less established cryptocurrencies. Anonymity Features: While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, various techniques, including mixers and tumblers, can be employed to enhance anonymity, making it harder to trace the flow of funds. The choice of Bitcoin highlights a crucial aspect of cryptocurrency theft – the end goal isn’t just stealing the assets but also laundering them effectively. Converting to Bitcoin, a more established and liquid cryptocurrency, is a strategic move in this direction. Diving into the Murky Waters of Crypto Mixers The report further reveals a concerning trend: the Lazarus Group is increasingly leveraging crypto mixers like Wasabi to obfuscate the trail of their illicit gains. A significant 193 BTC has already been processed through these mixers. But what exactly are crypto mixers, and why are they a headache for law enforcement and blockchain analysts? Crypto mixers, also known as tumblers, are services designed to break the link between the sender and receiver of cryptocurrency transactions. They work by pooling together various transactions and mixing them, making it exceedingly difficult to trace the origin and destination of specific funds. Wasabi Wallet, specifically mentioned in the report, is a Bitcoin wallet known for its privacy features, including coin mixing capabilities. Challenges Posed by Crypto Mixers: Enhanced Anonymity: Mixers significantly enhance the anonymity of transactions, making it exponentially harder to track the flow of stolen funds. Decentralization: Many mixers operate in a decentralized or semi-decentralized manner, making it challenging to shut them down or regulate their activities. Technical Complexity: Decoding mixer transactions requires advanced blockchain analysis techniques and expertise, posing a significant hurdle for investigators. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou’s call for experts to help decode these mixer transactions underscores the gravity of the situation. Unraveling the complexities of mixer transactions is now the biggest challenge in recovering the remaining stolen funds. The Silver Lining: Traceability and Frozen Assets Despite the Lazarus Group’s sophisticated methods, there’s a glimmer of hope. The report indicates that a substantial 88.87% of the stolen funds remain traceable. This means that while the hackers have been active, a significant portion of the loot is still within reach, at least in theory. Furthermore, 3.54% of the stolen funds have already been frozen, demonstrating that efforts to track and seize these assets are yielding some results. Key Positives: High Traceability Rate: 88.87% traceability offers a significant window of opportunity for recovery efforts. Successful Freezing: The 3.54% of frozen funds is a testament to the effectiveness of current tracking and seizure mechanisms. Increased Awareness: Reports like this from Bybit CEO raise crucial awareness within the crypto community and among regulatory bodies, prompting collaborative action. However, the race against time is on. The longer these funds remain untraced and unrecovered, the greater the risk of them being fully laundered and disappearing into the digital ether. Actionable Insights and the Path Forward What can be learned from this high-profile North Korea hackers incident, and what steps can be taken to mitigate future risks? For Cryptocurrency Exchanges: Enhanced Security Measures: Continuously upgrade security protocols, including multi-signature wallets, cold storage, and robust intrusion detection systems. Advanced Transaction Monitoring: Implement sophisticated blockchain analytics tools to detect and flag suspicious transaction patterns, including those associated with known mixers. Collaboration and Information Sharing: Foster greater collaboration with blockchain analysis firms, law enforcement agencies, and other exchanges to share threat intelligence and best practices. For Cryptocurrency Users: Due Diligence: Exercise caution when interacting with new or unverified crypto platforms and services. Security Best Practices: Employ strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and use hardware wallets for storing significant crypto holdings. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest security threats and vulnerabilities in the crypto space. The Lazarus Group’s audacious Bitcoin conversion serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing battle between innovation and exploitation in the cryptocurrency realm. While the decentralized and borderless nature of crypto offers immense opportunities, it also presents unique challenges in combating illicit activities. The crypto community, regulatory bodies, and law enforcement agencies must work in concert to develop more effective strategies for preventing, detecting, and responding to sophisticated cyber threats like those posed by the Lazarus Group. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Crypto World The revelation by Bybit CEO Ben Zhou is more than just a news update; it’s a urgent wake-up call for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Lazarus Group’s sophisticated tactics, particularly their adept use of Bitcoin conversion and crypto mixers, underscore the evolving nature of cybercrime in the digital age. While the high traceability rate and frozen assets offer a sliver of hope, the challenge of decoding mixer transactions remains a significant hurdle. The crypto world must heed this warning and double down on collaborative efforts to enhance security, improve transaction monitoring, and develop innovative solutions to stay one step ahead of these determined cyber adversaries. The fight against cryptocurrency theft is far from over, and vigilance is our strongest weapon.

Article 186: European equity funds see largest 4-week inflows of the decade as interest shifts from U.S. stocks
Content:
European equity funds recorded the largest four-week inflows in nearly the past 10 years, with European stocks outperforming U.S. stocks. European stocks are also seeing the latest weekly inflows recorded since February 2022, before the Russia-Ukraine war began. The surge is due to rising expectations that European governments will pour more funding into defense and infrastructure amid the U.S.’s pullback of its support for Ukraine. Bank of America Corp. data further revealed that money market funds attracted over $50 billion, gold attracted over $1 billion, stocks drew in over $22 billion, and bonds attracted over $12 billion. Emerging markets and technology stocks contributed to the large inflows experienced over the past few weeks. Passive fund inflows into European markets have further hit over $6 billion, marking the 10th consecutive week of inflows. Active funds have still seen more outflows this week, losing over $1.2 billion and marking the 43rd consecutive week of outflows. The funds have lost over $11 billion year-to-date. BofA strategist Michael Hartnett suggested that the current trend seen in European equity funds could continue to outperform U.S. funds, including the Stoxx 600 outperforming the S&P 500. BofA also mentioned that more investors expected European stocks and funds to maintain their strength throughout the year. The bank’s latest Fund Manager Survey indicated that 60% of investors believed in the positive health of European money markets and a sharp sentiment shift from U.S. markets. The survey also pointed out that the current sentiment shift from the U.S. to European markets is the sharpest rotation seen since 1999. 39% of investors currently hold overweight positions in European funds, compared to 12% recorded last month. 23% of investors also reported underweight positions in U.S. stocks, compared to 17% holding overweight positions last month. U.S. stocks may continue to underperform in the coming months The U.S. money markets have been struggling in the first months of President Trump’s administration due to the economic policies now viewed as less-than-favorable. The BofA survey indicated that investors were dumping the U.S. stocks at the fastest rate ever seen, supported by the recent 40-percent-point reduction in investors’ hold on long positions on U.S. stocks. The downturn has benefited other regions, especially Europe and China. Market indices for the U.S. money markets have also been underperforming, with the Nasdaq Industrial Composite, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Index all dropping over the past few weeks. The indices saw recovery during the weekend for the first time in several weeks but opened lower on Monday as investors failed to maintain the upward momentum. The reversed momentum has also raised speculation that more Wall Street sell-offs are to be expected in the near future. Deutsche Bank chief strategist Bankhim Chadha recently mentioned that there would be more sell-offs in U.S. equities before the indices recovered, stating the possibility of the S&P 500 recovering by 24%. Morgan Stanley’s chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, also mentioned that there would not be a sustainable rally for a while. The Fund Manager Survey revealed that 69% of fund managers believed that U.S. stock exceptionalism was ending. The sentiment has also created concerns that U.S. stocks will continue to underperform in the coming months. Goldman Sachs analyst Peter Oppenheimer recently warned that U.S. capital markets had shifted from high to moderate performance. Oppenheimer further commented on the current shift toward other regions’ funds, adding that Trump’s policies could drive the shift further. European active ETFs receive more attention from ETF investors The ongoing economic concerns in the U.S. have also shifted ETF investors from U.S.-based ETFs to European active ETFs. The European active ETFs industry is projected to grow to over $1 trillion in assets under management in the coming years. Wall Street asset management firms, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sach Asset Management, and BlackRock Inc., have expressed interest in launching active ETFs on European exchanges. European Ucits ETFs have also seen a surge in inflows in the past month, with over 33 billion euros flowing into the funds, marking a 16% increase compared to January. U.S.-based crypto ETFs have seen massive outflows over the past few weeks following the continued economic uncertainty in the country. U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs shed $5.5 billion in the past 5 weeks, with Trump’s tariffs driving investors away from riskier assets. The massive outflows notably began after Trump’s entry into office in January, with recent crypto-friendly news failing to drive interest in the ETFs. Cryptocurrencies have also been underperforming, with CryptoQuant’s Ki Young Ju recently suggesting that the bull run was over. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Article 187: BTC, ETH, XRP Price Prediction as S&P 500 Index Rockets, Gold Hits ATH
Content:
Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) prices rose modestly on Thursday after Jerome Powell’s transitory statement on inflation. BTC price retested the important resistance at $86,000, while ETH rose to $2,000 and XRP price hit $2.5. So, how will these blue-chip crypto market coins react as the S&P 500 index and gold prices surge? S&P 500 Index and Gold Prices Are Soaring Popular players in the crypto market, like BTC, ETH, and XRP may benefit from the ongoing surge of other risky assets. The S&P 500 index, which tracks the biggest US companies, rose to $5,700, up by over 3% from the lowest point this month. Popular American indices like the Dow Jones and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 have also jumped. At the same time, gold price has continued surging this year and is sitting at its all-time high. It has jumped in the last three consecutive weeks, making it one of the year’s best-performing assets. US stocks and gold continued rising after the Fed interest rate decision . The bank decided to leave interest rates unchanged and hinted that it would start tapering its quantitive tightening (QT) process. Most notably, Jerome Powell said that Trump tariff would cause transitory inflation, meaning that the bank would consider delivering more rate cuts this year. Mohamed El-Erian blasted that view, saying : “ I would have thought that, particularly after the big policy mistake of earlier this decade and given all the current uncertainties, some Fed officials would show greater humility . It’s simply too early to say with any regress of confidence that the inflationary effects will be transitory.” The soaring S&P 500 index and gold prices are bullish for crypto prices like BTC, ETH, and XRP since these assets have some correlation. BTC Price Technical Analysis While the ongoing S&P 500 index and gold price rally is positive for the BTC price, technicals point to uncertainties ahead. The main risk is that Bitcoin price has formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages crossed each other. Bitcoin has also formed a rising wedge, which is made up of two ascending and converging trendlines. It often leads to a bearish breakout. As CoinGape wrote earlier, Bitcoin key liquidation levels point to more downside. If this happens, the most likely scenario is where BTC price crashes to $73,587, the highest point in March last year. BTC price Chart ETH Price Technical Analysis While ETH price has bounced back from the lowest point this month, it remains below the important resistance point at $2,138. This is a crucial level since it was the neckline of the triple-top pattern at $4,000. The bearish ETH price forecast will remain as long as it is below that resistance level and the 50-day moving average at $2,300. More downside will be confirmed Ethereum price drops below $1,763. ETH Price Chart XRP Price Technical Analysis Ripple price rose after the end of the SEC vs Ripple case . However, it is notable that the coin has struggled to move above the resistance at $3, which is its make-or-break level. A clear bullish outlook will be confirmed if it rises above that level since it is the right and left shoulders of the head and shoulders pattern. Therefore, there is a risk that it will resume the downtrend as investors sell the fact. A drop to $1 will be confirmed if it crashes below $1.9, the neckline. XRP price chart Summary The crypto market, US stocks, and gold prices rose after the Fed decision. However, crypto prices like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP may struggle to sustain those gains, leading to an eventual crash.

Article 190: Chainlink (LINK) on the Brink: Critical Levels to Watch Now
Content:
Chainlink (LINK) is struggling with volatility, trading at $14.46 after a failed breakout at $15.17. The price initially climbed within an ascending triangle on the 1-hour chart but faced sharp rejection at resistance, triggering a pullback. Now, LINK is testing the $14.40 support zone, a key battleground for buyers. Key Levels to Watch A drop below $14.40 could accelerate selling, pushing LINK toward $14.20. Losing this level may break the ascending triangle’s trendline support, shifting momentum bearish and increasing downside risk. If buyers defend $14.40, a rebound toward $15.17 is likely. A breakout above this resistance would reverse the failed breakout, turning sentiment bullish. If momentum builds, LINK could target $17.40, a critical resistance for confirming a larger uptrend. Breakout Potential A decisive move above $17.40 could spark a long-term rally , attracting more buyers and strengthening market confidence. This scenario would favor both short-term traders and long-term holders.

Article 193: Has Bitcoin Really Entered a Bear Market? Analyst Weighs In
Content:
Bitcoin’s recent price movement has sparked debate among analysts over whether the original cryptocurrency has entered a bear market. Renowned analyst Ali Martinez recently shared an in-depth analysis assessing Bitcoin’s (BTC) trend using multiple technical indicators and on-chain data. In his study, Martinez suggested that while BTC might be shifting into a bearish phase, certain factors could still support a recovery. Key Indicators Signal Bearish Momentum First, Martinez highlighted the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse, a metric tracking Bitcoin movement between spot and derivative exchanges. According to the analyst, BTC is currently in a “corrective phase,” often marked by declining prices or stabilization after a strong rally. Bitcoin has corrected 23% from its peak of over $109,000 in late January during President Donald Trump’s inauguration. He also pointed to the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Ratio, which has turned negative—a historical signal of weakening momentum. Additionally, his Market Cycle Indicator suggests that Bitcoin could be in the early stages of a bear market, aligning with past downturns. Further evidence comes from large investor activity, particularly among miners and whales. On-chain data shared by Martinez showed that miners recently sold over $27 million in bitcoin profits, which often signals a shift toward caution in the market. Meanwhile, whale activity shows that major BTC holders have liquidated more than $260 million, adding to overall selling pressure. Compounding these concerns is a sharp decline in capital inflows—new investments entering Bitcoin. Monthly inflows have dropped significantly from $135 billion in December 2024 to just $4 billion on March 18, 2025, indicating weaker demand and a potential lack of fresh buying power. Can Bitcoin Hold Key Support Levels? Despite these bearish signals, Martinez identified key support levels that could stabilize Bitcoin’s price. According to the analyst, the $66,000–$69,000 range has emerged as a crucial zone where buyers might step in. To back this, Martinez shared a chart from IntoTheBlock that shows that 750,000 investors purchased 313,000 BTC around the $69,000 price range. He also shared Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution, which suggests strong support near $69,354—further reinforcing the idea that Bitcoin could find a floor in this range. Moreover, he pointed out that the Mayer Multiple and Bitcoin’s position relative to its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) suggests $66,000 as another critical level to watch. However, Martinez mentioned a potential bullish scenario tied to global liquidity. According to his analysis, rising liquidity levels have historically helped BTC recover, pointing to April as a possible turning point. If the leading crypto asset manages to reclaim $93,700 as support, it could signal a renewed uptrend, with a potential move toward $111,000, Martinez said. Despite these bearish concerns, BTC surged 4% to enter a 10-day high of $85,900 following the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady.

Article 194: Solana (SOL) holders are rushing toward this emerging DeFi coin for massive gains
Content:
As the DeFi market continues to expand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been gaining attention from investors looking for fresh opportunities. With a structured presale model, a rapidly growing user base, and a lending ecosystem designed for long-term sustainability, Mutuum Finance is becoming a strong alternative for those looking beyond traditional crypto assets like Solana (SOL). Why Solana holders are looking elsewhere Solana has been a dominant force in the blockchain space, offering high-speed transactions and low fees. However, as the market matures, investors are exploring new projects with higher growth potential. While Solana’s technology remains strong, its price movement has slowed, and competition in the DeFi space is increasing. This shift in investor behavior has led many SOL holders to diversify their portfolios, seeking out opportunities that offer better entry points and stronger upside potential. Mutuum Finance has positioned itself as a project that not only offers utility but also an early-stage advantage, attracting investors eager to participate in a protocol designed for sustainable growth. The project’s decentralized, non-custodial lending system enables users to supply assets and earn yield while borrowers can access capital through overcollateralized loans. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has already secured over $4 million in funding, with more than 6,200 holders participating in its presale. The token is currently in Phase 3 at $0.02, with the next phase set to increase the price to $0.025—a 25% jump. With 11 total presale phases and a launch price of $0.06, early investors are securing their positions before further price increases. This structured presale model creates consistent upward momentum, giving investors a clear roadmap for price appreciation. Unlike established cryptocurrencies that often rely on unpredictable market conditions, Mutuum Finance has a built-in growth mechanism that rewards early investors and fosters long-term participation. Mutuum Finance is built for decentralized lending, offering dynamic interest rates that adjust based on liquidity pool activity. Users receive mtTokens, which grow in value over time, ensuring a continuous yield. Unlike speculative assets, MUTM has a clear use case within its lending ecosystem, creating sustained demand. Additionally, the platform employs a buy-and-distribute model, using a portion of protocol fees to support MUTM’s price stability and long-term growth. Mutuum Finance has also launched a $100,000 giveaway, offering participants a chance to win MUTM tokens. This initiative aims to encourage broader engagement and strengthen the ecosystem by attracting new users. The giveaway is designed to be accessible to all participants, with winners selected from those actively engaging with the platform, presale contributors, and community members. Is Mutuum Finance the next big move for DeFi investors? With Solana holders actively looking for new opportunities, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a clear choice for those who want to be part of an ecosystem with a defined growth plan. The early-stage investment potential, structured price appreciation, and DeFi-focused utilities make it an appealing option for investors who understand the importance of getting in at the right time. As more phases of the presale are completed and the token price continues to rise, Mutuum Finance is solidifying its position in the market. Investors who recognize the value of early adoption in DeFi protocols are making their move now, securing their MUTM holdings before the project’s full-scale launch. With a strong foundation, increasing demand, and real-world utility, Mutuum Finance is proving to be more than just a trending token—it’s shaping up to be one of the most promising projects in the DeFi space.

Asian investors are shifting from Tron and Binance Coin to newer projects. XYZVerse, a rising sports memecoin with explosive growth potential, is capturing investor attention. Table of Contents XYZVerse: Could this memecoin deliver 50x returns? Tron stagnates Binance Coin fluctuates Conclusion Prominent investors in Asia are reportedly offloading significant holdings of Tron and Binance Coin. At the same time, a lot of attention has shifted to an obscure altcoin priced at a fraction of a cent, which is rumored to have massive growth potential. This unexpected move is stirring curiosity in the crypto community as the details behind this hidden gem begin to emerge. XYZVerse: Could this memecoin deliver 50x returns? The excitement around XYZVerse isn’t just noise; it’s a genuine phenomenon. As the pioneering all-sports meme token, XYZVerse is rapidly bridging the gap between sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, sparking major interest. Unlike typical memecoins that thrive solely on fleeting trends, XYZVerse is carving out its own niche. By merging the exhilarating world of sports with the contagious energy of meme culture, XYZVerse has captured significant momentum. The presale is accelerating, allowing early adopters to secure tokens at prices far below their anticipated future value. Currently, XYZVerse remains in its presale stage, but investor demand is already high. The token’s price has impressively surged from an initial $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, and over 70% of the $15 million presale target has been achieved. With a final projected presale price of $0.1, early participants are set for significant returns. XYZVerse’s popularity is evident on CoinMarketCap, where the community sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. With a remarkable 95% of voters forecasting further growth for XYZ, optimism is undeniably high. Influential crypto figures have also noticed XYZVerse’s potential. Crypto influencer DanjoCapitalMaster, who boasts nearly 800,000 followers, recently labeled XYZVerse as a “moonshot opportunity.” While the crypto market always involves risks, the buzz surrounding XYZVerse is undeniably strong. Beyond mere speculation, XYZVerse boasts structured and sustainable tokenomics. A significant 15% allocation to liquidity ensures robust market foundations, while another 10% is set aside for community rewards through airdrops and bonuses. Additionally, a substantial 17.13% of the supply is earmarked for deflationary burns, potentially enhancing token scarcity and value. What truly distinguishes XYZVerse is its emphasis on community involvement. Through initiatives like the Ambassador Program, supporters can earn tokens by actively promoting the project. Furthermore, discussions with prominent sports celebrities are underway, aiming to amplify XYZVerse’s visibility. By uniting passionate sports communities with the dynamic crypto ecosystem, XYZVerse is crafting an engaging and entertaining experience. Backed by a rapidly growing presale, enthusiastic community, and ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse possesses all the elements of a memecoin poised for explosive growth. While crypto markets are inherently unpredictable, savvy investors recognize the opportunity to participate early in a potentially promising project. With the presale window rapidly closing, the time to explore XYZVerse might be now.

Over the last month, it dipped by 3.93%. Looking at the past six months, TRX surged by 53.66%, showing strong growth over time. Currently, TRX trades between $0.20 and $0.23. The 10-day moving average is $0.24, while the 100-day average is $0.22. This places the price below the short-term average but above the long-term one.

Over six months, there’s an overall increase of 8.81%, reflecting moderate long-term growth. Trading between $532.97 and $647.57, BNB is approaching the nearest resistance at $692.63. A break above this could target the second resistance at $807.23, implying a potential gain of around 25%.

The RSI is at 39.37, nearing oversold territory, suggesting a possible rebound. The Stochastic indicator is low at 20.51, also pointing to overselling. However, the MACD level is negative at -3.1273, indicating bearish momentum. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages are close, showing a lack of clear trend direction. Based on these factors, BNB’s future movement is uncertain, but a significant breakout could occur soon.

Article 198: Ethereum Sepolia Testnet Faces Issues—Is DuragDoge the Real Winner of This Shift?
Content:
The post Ethereum Sepolia Testnet Faces Issues—Is DuragDoge the Real Winner of This Shift? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum (ETH) is on a prolonged downward trend, causing crypto users to wonder what is happening with the market’s second-largest crypto. Ethereum’s dip has incurred significant losses for its holders, with about 70% of ETH addresses clearly out of money. The token is plunging even deeper despite the network’s activity, such as the Pectra upgrade deployed on the Sepolia testnet to increase ETH’s worth. Despite the bear market, DuragDoge ($DURAG) is the real winner right now. Its features equip it with the resilience and longevity it needs to beat market conditions, so analysts rank it as the best cryptocurrency. The $DURAG token is among the best crypto pre-sales right now, and it continues to hit new records with its utility-driven features. Read on to discover why $DURAG is ten steps ahead in the game. Ethereum (ETH) Still in the Dip as its New Upgrade on Sepolia Testnet Faces Issues Ethereum’s most anticipated upgrade, Pectra , was deployed on its final testnet on March 5. The upgrade marks a significant milestone towards Ethereum’s goal of achieving the mainnet activation. Pectra has received immense support from community members, who hope the upgrade will boost ETH’s value. The upgrade also aims to improve Ethereum’s network activity and scalability. However, Pectra has yet to live up to its promises, as the developers encounter a hurdle on the Sepolia testnet. Tim Beiko , Ethereum Protocol Support Lead, said the problem is due to a custom deposit contract on Sepolia. This caused execution layer (EL) clients to face issues such as transaction delays within blocks. With this issue onboard, the mainnet activation launch date might be postponed, killing token holders’ hopes. This also means the ETH token might continue to plummet, as the upgrade was supposed to cause ETH to rally. The dip is affecting investors and token holders, as data from IntoTheBlock shows only about 26% of ETH addresses are making slight profits. This means that over 70% of Ethereum addresses have lost everything. No wonder holders are shifting to $DURAG, one of the best crypto coins to invest in. DuragDoge ($DURAG) Rallies, Emerges as the New Token With the Highest Potential DuragDoge is the new hot deal in the crypto market. It tops the chart as the best cryptocurrency to buy now.

These features place $DURAG many steps ahead of other meme coins, which is why it is currently recording one of the best crypto presales. $DURAG’s presales aim to give everyone early access to this golden token. This is why 1,240,000,000 $DURAG tokens are available at exclusive rates. The $DURAG token is gathering interest from crypto whales and users as it is one of the best crypto coins to invest in. DuragDoge ($DURAG) Gains Whales’ Approval With its Reward Features The $DURAG token is gaining widespread adoption due to its reward features that increase holders’ gains. One of $DURAG’s most profitable features is the staking and reward. Holders who stake their $DURAGs will earn up to 20% APY in rewards, boosting their portfolios significantly.

There will also be periodic burns to assure holders and investors of $DURAG’s security and longevity. These burns will regulate $DURAG’s circulation, making it a deflationary token whose value will continue to rise.

Article 200: Are Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) Staging a Comeback? Top 3 Memecoins Analyzed
Content:
The entire crypto market cap (excluding BTC) is up around 14% since a potential bottom was hit last week. Memecoins have also taken part in this recovery. The top 3 memecoins by market cap are analysed. Are $DOGE, $SHIB, and $PEPE making a comeback? Total2 will signal altcoin rally or rejection Source: TradingView Total2 is the chart of the combined market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies, excluding $BTC. Therefore it enables a reasonable assessment of how the altcoins are doing in general. It can be seen that a minor rally is currently taking place. For this rally to really take off, the descending trendline will have to be broken, and higher highs will need to be made. If this does take place, expect some of the prominent memecoins to take advantage. $DOGE potentially finds a bottom Source: TradingView The daily chart for $DOGE does show that this $25.5 billion memecoin may have finally found a bottom. The price was able to bounce from the ascending trendline, which was perhaps the very bottom, and is now battling to stay above the 0.786, the deepest of the Fibonacci retracement levels. A big plus is that the bulls have broken through the descending trendline. The price may be coming back down to retest this, possibly at $0.16 before going higher. If the bottom is indeed in for $DOGE, potential bounces from the indicators in the RSI, and Stochastic RSI, could help to get a powerful rally started. $SHIB in favourable position Source: TradingView The $SHIB price does look to be in a favourable position in the weekly chart. The bulls have forced it through the descending trendline, and the price is currently maintaining at the major horizontal support level. With the Stochastic RSI indicators on this time frame inclining upward from the bottom, all would appear to be perfect for a rally from here. That said, the support and the trendline would have to hold, and Bitcoin would need to take the lead. Important targets are at $0.000016, and then $$0.000021. Horizontal support proves its worth for $PEPE Source: TradingView $PEPE can probably be classed as a true memecoin, because all it has backing it is the air that we breathe. Even so, it has a market cap of more than $3 billion, and the price appears to be recovering nicely so far. The horizontal support at $0.000006 has proved its worth, and the price has bounced from there. Targets, according to the Fibonacci levels, are in the chart above.
